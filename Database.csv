0,Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder,"Incorporating ML models into clinical practice for predicting suicide risk in patients with BD appears promising, especially when using a multimodal, time-variant approach. As our findings have evidenced, integrating MRI features with clinical data may notably improve predictive accuracy for 12-month suicide risk in this population."
1,Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder,"Finally, it is important to mention that the selected features do not include all the possible risk factors for suicide. For example, we did not have data regarding traumas or adverse events available for our sample. These non-disease related factors are well documented in the literature [119,�120] and could add important value to ML prediction. Similarly, a more in-depth description of some clinical aspects of the disorder might be important. For example, recent studies suggested that specific sleep and circadian disturbance variables might confer unique risk for suicide in BD [121]. This highlights the importance of conducting a thorough sleep and circadian assessment in clinical practice and include such variables in ML models."
2,Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder,"In summary, the brain areas from frontal, temporal, and cerebellar regions that were selected in our model proved to have a role in the neurobiology of suicide, highlighting the relevance of the ML algorithm's feature selection from both a clinical and neurobiological perspective. However, it is important to mention that MRI scans present some critical issues in psychiatry. First of all, MRI scans present an important cost compared to clinical-demographic variables, and they require a relevant amount of time. Moreover, it is likely that very severe patients in acute wards are not able to endure an MRI scan, possibly creating a bias in terms of sample selection. These are critical aspects that should be further investigated in the future. Nonetheless, our results support the idea that MRI features can improve the ability of the algorithm to recognize patients at increased risk for suicide; future studies need to assess whether this increase in algorithm performance is feasible in terms of cost and time, compared to a simpler model based on clinical and demographic features."
3,Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder,"Consistent with our findings, structural alterations in temporal cortices were associated with suicide in a range of psychiatric disorders and related to high lethality attempts and higher impulsivity [96]. Specifically, alterations in middle and superior temporal gyrus volume were described in suicide attempters with primary psychotic disorders [102,�103], mood disorders [104], but also borderline personality disorders [105]. Reduced middle and superior temporal volumes were also associated with increased lethality [106] and higher impulsivity in individuals with suicidal behaviors with different mental disorders [107]. fMRI studies also pointed out the association between the superior temporal gyrus and suicidal behaviors. Specifically, suicidal ideation was associated with increased superior temporal activation during error processing in veterans with traumas [108], while lower perfusion in these temporal regions during rest was reported in mood disorders with suicidal ideation [109]. Moreover, the functional connectivity of the superior temporal gyrus was found to be associated with psychological risk factors, including loneliness and purpose in life, in a recent fMRI study [110]."
4,Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder,"The MRI features that mostly contributed to the prediction are mapped in the frontal (frontal pole, orbital gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus), temporal (planum temporale, and planum polare), and cerebellar regions."
5,Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder,"Lastly, our findings have identified current alcohol use as a significant clinical feature in predicting suicidal behavior among individuals with BD [90]. As a matter of fact, literature has evidenced that alcohol consumption may exacerbate mood instability, increase impulsivity, and impair judgment, all of which may contribute to heightened vulnerability to suicidal thoughts and actions [91,�92]. Moreover, alcohol's depressant effects may worsen depressive episodes, deepening feelings of hopelessness [93]. Studies have demonstrated that comorbid alcohol use disorder in bipolar patients is associated with a higher incidence of suicide attempts, underscoring the critical need for addressing alcohol use in suicide prevention strategies [94,�95]."
6,Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder,"Similarly, research has explored the impact of atypical antipsychotics on suicide risk in BD [79]. Some studies have indicated the potential for these drugs to exacerbate suicide risk in certain patients when compared to mood stabilizers such as lithium or valproate [80,�81]. However, these findings remain inconsistent and often overlook the role of illness severit [82-89]."
7,Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder,"However, the use of antiepileptics in BD has long been a point of contention, particularly in relation to suicide risk [73-77]."
8,Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder,"Among the other salient clinical features, prevalent polarity is particularly noteworthy, affirming that a predominant depressive polarity (as well as mixed affective states) may significantly elevate the risk of suicidal behavior in individuals with BD [36,�39,�41]. Furthermore, it is pertinent to mention that a familial history of psychiatric disorders and suicidal behaviors may also influence suicide risk, implying a possible genetic predisposition [37,�40]."
9,Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder,"From our results emerged a vulnerability based on a history of prior suicide attempts, with their significance likely escalating as the number of these attempts accumulates over a lifetime. This vulnerability appears to be further accentuated by the methods employed in suicide attempts, which may serve as an indicator of underlying intentionality. Indeed, as previously mentioned, among individuals with BD, the ratio of attempts to completed suicides is markedly lower than in the general population, revealing a proclivity for more violent and lethal means [23]."
10,Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder,"Interestingly, our results support the hypothesis that time-variant features could be very predictive in the model. For example, among the most predictive features there were ?suicide in the past 12 months? and ?suicide ideation in the past 12 months?, suggesting how the weight of features tends to vary according to different time windows. Furthermore, they encourage future research to employ, set up, or redefine ML algorithms for worse outcome prediction in a complex, superordinate, and multimodal, rather than unimodal perspective [67]."
11,Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder,"With our study, we aimed to employ different ML approaches combining different modalities to explore their ability to predict 12-month suicide attempts in BD patients. Firstly, we created unimodal models using either clinical or MRI features, which reached good accuracies, in line with other studies [70,�71]. Nevertheless, as could be expected in�situations characterized by uneven group distributions, unimodal models persistently demonstrated a disproportionate relationship between sensitivity and specificity."
12,Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder,"Given the results of the unimodal classifiers, we implemented a stacking-based data fusion model combining clinical and GM predictive decision scores, as described in the Method section."
13,Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder,"In the GM volumes model, the most relevant features for the prediction werethe left frontal pole, bilateral thalamus, right planum temporale, left cerebellum, right posterior orbital gyrus, left accumbens, right opercular part of the inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral ventral diencephalon, right cerebellum, right cuneus, right postcentral gyrus, and right planum polare. The most important areas are represented in Figure�3."
14,Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder,"Finally, the model based on thickness features yielded fewer results in terms of suicide prediction, with an AUC of 0.61, BAC 62.2%, sensitivity 40%, and specificity 84.9%."
15,Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder,"Regarding clinical data, the unimodal classifier created without the composite score of the intermediate visits reached an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.71, with a BAC of 68%, sensitivity of 40%, and specificity of 97.4%. Instead, the second model including scores derived from the intermediate visits overcame the first classifier, reaching an AUC of 0.83, BAC of 72.7%, sensitivity of 50%, and specificity of 95.4%. This model was able to correctly individuate one additional subject compared to the first model. However, the ability to identify individuals at risk of suicide (represented here by the sensitivity) remained low (50%). The model was significant with�p?<?0.01 (see Supplementary Figures?Supporting Informations)."
16,Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder,"Two separate models were then created, one including only baseline features and one also including the 3 timepoints composite scores."
17,Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder,"During the 12?months of observation, 10 patients (6.13%) attempted suicide; luckily, none of the attempts were lethal. The demographic characteristics of the sample are described in Table�1. No significant differences between attempters and non-attempters were found in demographics (sex, ages, education), psychiatric family history, use of substances and clinical scales. The only significant difference was in chlorpromazine equivalents, with non-attempters having higher scores (p?=?0.009)."
18,Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder,"SVM was employed to find a parsimonious combination of decision scores maximizing BAC across the C parameter range. As for the unimodal classifiers described above, we determined an ensemble of optimized SVM models across the C range that conjointly maximized BAC in the given CV1 training and test data. Then, the CV2 validation predictions of the previously trained individual classifiers' SVM ensembles were combined and standardized. Each SVM ensemble was then applied to this standardized CV2 decision score matrix to generate probability estimates. Majority voting was used to predict the CV2 outcome targets, and this procedure was repeated until all CV2 cases had received a multimodal prediction."
19,Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder,"After training the individual classifiers, we implemented a stacking-based data fusion framework [67,�68] to assess whether the combination of these unimodal classifiers would generate superior predictive systems for suicide attempts compared to using each classifier individually."
20,Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder,Permutations were used to define the significance of the model (See�Supporting Informations�and Figure�S1).
21,Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder,"Covariates nuisance was removed using Pearson correlations. Specifically, age, sex, MRI group, and TIV (only for GM) were removed."
22,Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder,Our preprocessing pipeline for the structural MRI classifiers (same pipeline for GM and thickness) consists of the following steps:
23,Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder,"Since many machine learning algorithms are sensitive to differences in feature scales, each variable was scaled to a [0,1] range to remove these effects from the training sample matrices."
24,Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder,"For both unimodal and multimodal models, a double-nested cross-validation (CV) scheme was created, in which k-fold CV (3 repetitions, 3 folds) at the inner and outer CV levels was created. The number of folds was determined based on the limited occurrence of events (suicide attempts) to ensure that each fold consistently included a sufficient number of patients who had attempted suicide."
25,Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder,"One hundred and sixty-three subjects with BD (mean age 44.81?+??15.28; 88%/53.9% females) were recruited at the Department of Mental Health of the IRCCS Ca? Granda, Policlinico Hospital in Milan (Italy). The enrolment was approved by the Et125hical Committee of the IRCCS Fondazione Ca? Granda Policlinico Hospital (Neuron-051, GR-2019-12369100, Cariplo2019?3415, GR-2016-02361283, Neuroinno, CANMAN). The diagnoses were confirmed by a trained psychiatrist, using the Structured Clinical Interview (SCID) from the DSM-IV [61]."
26,Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder,"Specifically, our aims are to: (1) develop unimodal models for predicting 12-month suicide risk in patients with BD, utilizing clinical and MRI features; (2) evaluate the impact of time-dynamic features on prediction accuracy; and (3) investigate whether integrating multimodal features can improve the prediction of suicide attempts. We hypothesized that a multimodal approach could improve the prediction of suicide attempts, therefore fully exploiting ML potential, and that time-dynamic features would results among the most predictive."
27,Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder,"Several ML studies also tried to predict suicide in different populations [56], reaching good prediction accuracies. The most common populations assessed are mood disorders, especially major depression and BD, but several studies predicted suicide behaviors in a transdiagnostic fashion, without stratifying the sample by diagnoses [56]. Nevertheless, the current literature on suicide risk in BD appears constrained by several limitations. First of all, most of the studies [57,�58] assessed suicide attempts in a cross-sectional fashion (e.g., prediction of lifetime suicide attempts), without defining prospectively a time window of analysis; second, most of the studies [59,�60] employed unimodal approaches, not exploiting the full potential of ML approaches that allow handling multimodal data; moreover, ML models usually implement time-fixed variables, even though it is clear that some features tend to vary across time (e.g., a suicide attempt few months ago might have a higher weight in the prediction of future attempts, when compared to a suicide attempt occurred 20?years ago), in the end failing to fully capture the dynamic and multifaceted nature of suicide risk."
28,Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder,"At the current state, the identification of at-risk patients still relies primarily on clinical assessments and patient history. However, studies have shown that traditional suicide risk factors have only limited clinical predictive value and present a relatively poor clinical utility in predicting suicide occurrence, even in high-risk populations, such as depressed patients [49,�50]."
29,Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder,"Nevertheless, the most critical determinants appear to be illness-related. These include a history of previous suicide attempts (especially with violent/highly lethal methods), a family history of suicide, and predominantly depressive episodes, particularly when accompanied by mixed affective states [29,�36-41]. Rapid cycling, a high number of previous episodes, early onset and early stage of the illness, a long duration of untreated illness and scarce adherence to treatment, and comorbid conditions such as anxiety disorders, substance abuse, or personality disorders have also been reported to further elevate risk [4,�6,�23,�42-45]."
30,Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder,"Specifically, mood disorders are the most frequently reported diagnoses leading to suicidal behavior, with individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder (BD) appearing at an even greater risk. In fact, it has been reported that 40% of individuals with BD attempt suicide at least once in their lifetime [12,�13], with the annual risk of suicide attempts among BD patients estimated to be 400?1400 per 100,000, or approximately 0.9%, which is 30?60 times higher than the rate observed in the general population [14-22]. Moreover, a recent review of the literature indicates that the standardized mortality ratio is approximately 20- to 30-fold higher compared to the general population, with the estimated suicide mortality rate among BD patients being roughly 0.2?0.4 per 100 person-year [6], indicating a higher lethality of suicide attempts within this population [23]."
31,Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder,"Suicidal behaviors are a major global public health issue, challenging psychiatry and society, with more than 720.000 suicide-related deaths occurring annually in the general population [1] and with the global rate of suicide estimated to be 9.4 per 100,000 individuals (95% CI 8.5?10.3) [2]. An extensive range of factors has been reported to influence suicidal behavior rates, including gender, age, temporal factors, ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds, and medical history, particularly with regard to mental health [3]."
32,Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder,"During the 12 months, 6.13% of patients attempted suicide. The unimodal classifier based on clinical data reached an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.83 and balanced accuracy (BAC) of 72.7%. The model based on GM reached an AUC of 0.86 and BAC of 76.4%. The multimodal classifier (clinical + GM) reached an AUC of 0.88 and BAC of 83.4%, significantly increasing the sensitivity. The most important features were related to suicide attempts history, medications, comorbidities, and depressive polarity. In the GM model, the most relevant features mapped in the frontal, temporal, and cerebellar regions."
33,Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder,"Bipolar disorder (BD) patients present an increased risk of suicide attempts. Most current machine learning (ML) studies predicting suicide attempts are cross-sectional, do not employ time-dependent variables, and do not assess more than one modality. Therefore, we aimed to predict 12-month suicide attempts in a sample of BD patients, using clinical and brain imaging data."
34,Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis,"Finally, while our study demonstrates that Black residents are overrepresented in neighborhoods where high-risk factors for poor mental health are localized, our approach does not address risk for Black community members who live in non-Black majority communities. Moreover, our classification of communities as Black, Hispanic, and White does not recognize diversity within these racial demographics (eg, Puerto Rican vs Mexican heritage) [40]."
35,Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis,"Insights gained from the disproportionality indices reveal the need for targeted interventions and policy adjustments in Milwaukee communities. These indices do not only demonstrate disparities but are also critical for guiding approaches that can address racial imbalances in mental health, steering toward a more equitable health care system. Our findings align with research demonstrating that mental health outcomes are the products of spatially located phenomena, including socioeconomic conditions, access to health care, environmental factors, and deeply rooted SRD [36]. This confluence of factors reinforces the assertion that conventional global ?one-size-fits-all? approaches fall short of understanding complex phenomena such as community mental health or the intricacies of structural racism and discrimination [19,23]. When processes are governed by their location and by conditions that fluctuate over time, the use of localized spatial modeling approaches offers a more realistic alignment, yielding more accurate and nuanced results. This perspective challenges traditional frameworks and calls for a tailored approach that considers the unique characteristics of each community, reflecting a more comprehensive understanding of mental health disparities (Table 1) [37-39]."
36,Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis,"Age is a determinant of mental health. Adult mental health diagnoses often begin in adolescence, with approximately half of all adult mental health disorders emerging in the teenage years [33]. The median onset age ranges from 8 to 35 years, and increased age is associated with better mental health [34]. Chen et al [35] found that the relationship between census tracts? median age and prevalence of poor mental health follows a negative curvilinear trend, consistent with a large-scale meta-analysis of 192 epidemiological studies. Our results demonstrate that poor mental health in the central city neighborhoods of Milwaukee County is more significantly associated with age than in other parts of the county, indicating that the influence of age on mental health varies locally."
37,Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis,"The connection between poverty and mental health not only emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive investigation into policy, poverty, inequality, and mental health outcomes but also highlights the multifaceted nature of mental health challenges [29]. Our study shows that the relationship is complex and plateaus when more than 50% of community lives below the poverty level. Overall, poverty is a stronger defining characteristic of poor mental health in the central neighborhoods of Milwaukee."
38,Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis,"Several relationships were identified, demonstrating the complex determinants of mental health in different contexts. A link between smoking prevalence and mental health was noted, revealing regional variation and reflecting broader patterns in mental health research. While the percentage of adults reporting poor mental health increased with smoking [25,26], the trend flattened at a prevalence of 17%. Smoking was more significantly associated with poor mental health in central city neighborhoods and northern suburbs of Milwaukee County but had a lower effect in the south side."
39,Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis,"To address the complex issue of SRD and its impact on mental health disparities, our study used a 5-step process. First, we compiled a comprehensive database of place-based explanatory factors, also known as ?geospatial determinants of health,? at the census tract scale [24]. Second, we deliberately eliminated all race-based factors, an unprecedented approach to assess whether SRD effects on mental health disparities could be examined without directly referencing race. Third, we conducted a variable selection process, identifying the most defining place-based characteristics that shape the mental health conditions of an affected community. Fourth, using SOMs, we clustered census tracts based on mental health risk factor similarity. Finally, we investigated the racial composition, demographic characteristics, and spatial dependency of risk areas to shed light on racial disparities, confirmed SRD, and illuminated the locationality of mental health and SRD (Table 1)."
40,Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis,"The spatial dependency of risk areas was investigated to discover the locationality of poor mental health areas. To examine the degree of similarity, the Global Moran I index was calculated to measure the degree of similarity between an area and its neighboring areas. The calculated Moran Index is 0.53 with a�z�score of 21.63, indicating that there is <1% likelihood that the clustering of poor mental health risk was the result of random chance. The findings, displayed in�Figure 4, show that clusters 2 and 3 are primarily located in central city neighborhoods of Milwaukee County, aligning with predominantly Black communities in the central and north side of the city and with the Hispanic community in Milwaukee?s south side."
41,Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis,"In the moderate risk group (cluster 2), the White population is underrepresented, with an index of 0.6; the Black and Hispanic populations are overrepresented, with indices of 1.52 and 1.51, respectively. The most significant disparity was found in the high-risk group (cluster 3), where the Black population?s disproportionality index was 2.23, and the White and Hispanic populations were underrepresented with indices of 0.34 and 0.51, respectively."
42,Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis,"Figure 4�represents the geospatial distribution of the 3 mental health risk clusters across Milwaukee County. Classification into low-, moderate-, and high-risk labels refers to the collective intensity of the 12 key place-based mental health factors within each cluster. For instance, the ?high-risk? label indicates the prevalence of higher levels of risk factors (ie, smoking prevalence, lack of health insurance, and poverty) known to contribute to poor mental health but does not necessarily mean that all individuals in this cluster have poor mental health."
43,Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis,"Next, we used GWRF to investigate and visualize local associations between poor mental health prevalence and the 12 identified place-based risk factors at multiple scales?the county, the city, and census tract levels. Six place-based risk factors (prevalence of smoking, lack of insurance, poverty, insufficient sleep, employment, and age) were identified as having a spatially heterogeneous impact. We trained the GWRF with 45 nearest neighbors (census tracts) with bootstrapped 5000 ?ntrees? and 4 ?mtry? in each tree. It yielded a local model with an�R2�square (OOB) of 94.91%, mean squared error (OOB) of 0.051, and Akaike Information Criterion (OOB) of ?856.447. Spatial variation of the local contribution of the 6 risk factors to the prediction of poor mental health is shown in�Figure 2."
44,Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis,"The VSURF procedure was applied to the 105 place-based factors to find a sufficiently parsimonious set of significant indicators of poor community mental health (ie, the percentage of adults who stated that their mental health was not good 14 or more days in the past month) and measures of SRD. The VSURF selected 98 variables at the thresholding step, then 24 variables at the interpretation step, and 12 variables at the prediction step. The most important place-based factors of mental health were adults who smoke, insufficient sleep, adults without health insurance, adults who are obese, adults who are sedentary, marriage rate, people living below the poverty level, childhood opportunity index score, median age, homeownership, full-time employment, and educational attainment (all variables are percentages except for Age and Childhood Opportunity Index score). These variables account for 95.11% of the variability in poor mental health in communities, with a mean of squared residuals of 0.74."
45,Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis,"This study uses anonymized and deidentified publicly available data sets that were released by federal or state agencies for public consumption. All publicly available government data are aggregated at the census tract level, where each tract is composed of 4000 individuals. We received full approval from the Medical College of Wisconsin institutional review board with exemption from oversight by Code of Federal Regulations 46.104 (d) 4, as we conducted secondary analyses of publicly available anonymized and deidentified data sets that do not contain any personally identifiable information and do not pose any risk to ethical violations. Given that the project did not involve direct contact with subjects, an informed consent process was not required and no compensation was provided. Moreover, the project did not require a waiver of HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) authorization as outlined in 45 Code of Federal Regulations 164.514(e) because it used a Limited Data Set."
46,Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis,"Local feature importance in GWRF measures how much each feature contributes to the accuracy of the model within a specific region, calculated by the increase in mean squared error or the decrease in node impurities averaged over all trees in the model. These measures are derived from the out-of-bag (OOB) error, which is a measure of the model?s performance on data not used during training [20]."
47,Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis,"Extreme multicollinearity can cause parameter estimate instability, unintuitive parameter signs, high�R2�diagnostics despite few or no significant parameters, and inflated standard errors of the parameter estimates [16]. To avoid this, variance inflation factor (VIF) and Pearson correlation analysis are used to detect multicollinearity and select the most uncorrelated variables for the random forest variable selection model. The variable selection method [17] implemented in the Variable Selection Using Random Forest (VSURF) R package (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) yields the best results compared with other variable selection and baseline methods [18]. The method ranks variables by their importance, eliminating the least important ones and constructing a sequence of random forest models. Eventually, variables of the most optimized model are selected."
48,Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis,"To identify geospatial determinants of health across behavioral indicators, built environment, sociocultural environment, and health care (based on the NIMHD framework), georeferenced data sets were acquired from the United States Census Bureau. The United States Census Bureau anonymizes and deidentifies data before releasing them to the public. Detailed demographic data can be obtained only at the Census Tract level (each tract comprises 4000 residents) and not at an individual level. In accordance with census policies, we analyzed all data at the census tract level, and no individual-level data have been obtained or used. Selected variables (eg, age, gender, population, race, ethnicity, marital status, educational attainment, educational enrollment, employment, neighborhood stability, and poverty) were compiled into a data set of 217 explanatory variables. Notably, race-based factors were deliberately withheld during the initial stages of our unsupervised machine learning analysis. This approach allowed the model to operate without the assumption that racial disparities significantly influence mental health outcomes. It was only in the final stage of the analysis that race and ethnicity variables were incorporated, providing an opportunity to observe whether the emerging patterns of poor mental health prevalence correlated with racial factors. All variables were joined to the administrative boundary shapefile of Milwaukee County census tracts collected from the TIGER/Line database11 (using ArcGIS Desktop 10.7; Environmental Systems Research Institute)."
49,Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis,"This study used the NIMHD framework to explore the relationship between SRD and mental health. By using machine learning algorithms with geodata science, we conducted spatial modeling and geovisualization to investigate how location-based factors, indicative of SRD, impact mental and physical health. This approach allows for a statistical analysis of these dynamics over time and space, offering a comprehensive analysis of the effects of place on health outcomes [11]. Data were analyzed at multiple geographic scales?county, city, and census tracts. Understanding mental health at the community level is important, given the complex intersectionality of factors that promote or hinder health in the United States [12]."
50,Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis,"Past research has focused on the relationship between interpersonal discrimination and health; however, SRD is likely to have broad downstream effects on psychological, biological, physiological, and behavioral processes [4]. Mental health is of particular importance, especially since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, where estimates of pooled prevalence of depression are 7 times higher than expected [5], with minority Americans experiencing more severe and chronic symptoms across time [6]. As individuals are embedded within larger systems of influence, it is essential to understand the relationship between SRD and mental health at a community level [5]. The socioecological model of health provides a framework to examine how individual health and behavior are impacted by interpersonal, neighborhood, and societal factors [7]. The National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) has encouraged a place-based approach, as ?relationships between SRD and physical/mental health are influenced by numerous place-based factors? individual-level factors (i.e., health-related behaviors, ways of coping) are understood best within the context of the lived environment and structural policies that perpetuate inequities? [1]."
51,Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis,"The findings demonstrate that structural racism shapes mental health disparities, with Black community members disproportionately impacted. The multifaceted methodological approach underscores the value of integrating geospatial analysis and deep learning to understand complex social determinants of mental health. These insights highlight the need for targeted interventions, addressing both individual and systemic factors to mitigate mental health disparities rooted in structural racism."
52,Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis,"We compiled 217 georeferenced explanatory variables across domains, initially deliberately excluding race-based factors to focus on nonracial determinants. This approach was designed to reveal the underlying patterns of risk factors contributing to poor mental health, subsequently reintegrating race to assess the effects of racism quantitatively. The variable selection combined tree-based methods (random forest) and conventional techniques, supported by variance inflation factor and Pearson correlation analysis for multicollinearity mitigation. The geographically weighted random forest model was used to investigate spatial heterogeneity and dependence. Self-organizing maps, combined with K-means clustering, were used to analyze data from Milwaukee communities, focusing on quantifying the impact of structural racism on the prevalence of poor mental health."
53,Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis,"Structural racism produces mental health disparities. While studies have examined the impact of individual factors such as poverty and education, the collective contribution of these elements, as manifestations of structural racism, has been less explored. Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, with its racial and socioeconomic diversity, provides a unique context for this multifactorial investigation."
54,Mental health stigma: a conundrum for healthcare practitioners in conservative communities,"It has been shown that conservative communities face a unique set of problems related to the stigma around mental health and its persistence. While educating healthcare professionals and the public is crucial to changing the cultural narrative, there may also be other alternative approaches that can provide solutions, especially considering the current speed of advance in digital technologies. It may also be possible for religious and cultural norms to be embedded within that technology. That is, given the multiple challenges plaguing the healthcare system in conservative communities, the integration of technology may prove beneficial in enhancing mental health services, especially for individuals suffering from anxiety and depression (36). Although there is a dearth of research on chatbots for mental health in the MENA region, Ujiro et al. (37) report that there may be some progress, as shown in the use of a chatbot called OlloBot, which has been used by doctors to help patients manage their diseases at home and triage patients (37). With this evidence, it becomes imperative to source alternative remedies, such as artificial intelligence tools that are less stigmatizing to PWMI, while attempts are made to improve attitudes and health systems reform and re-strategize to position mental healthcare at the heart of the people they serve."
55,Mental health stigma: a conundrum for healthcare practitioners in conservative communities,"Whatever the root cause of the problem, action to change the attitudes of the general public toward mental health in conservative communities, alongside health reforms and training for HCW, is urgently required. This should include addressing gender norms and the consideration of culture and religion to form effective solutions. According to Alattar et al. (6) (p. 192), to change the cultural narrative around mental illness, ?Education and anti-stigma campaigns need to be developed and further training needs to be developed for mental health professionals who need to offer greater support in this area.? In the meantime, alternative therapies and support mechanisms may be useful to provide much needed support to individuals with poor mental health."
56,Mental health stigma: a conundrum for healthcare practitioners in conservative communities,"Situated in the MENA region, Saudi Arabia is predominantly an Islamic country, and as such, the views and attitudes toward PWMI and the use of mental healthcare services may have been shaped by cultural practices and religion (6). Accordingly, a Saudi hospital-based study suggests that there may be a bias toward PWMI (29). This can be seen in reports that show that about half of a sample of specialist doctors held stigmatizing views toward PWMI (30). This again shows that individuals with higher education, even among those who are medically trained, may be involved in the stigmatizing and shaming of people with mental healthcare needs (10,�29). Regarding this point, Alamri (29) highlights that in the general population, there is skepticism about taking part in mental health conversations or accessing mental health screening programs. This is based on beliefs that such programs are meant only for people suffering from insanity. In addition, patriarchy is well engrained in many of these communities (31), and as documented, men in these settings are more likely than women to express negative attitudes toward PWMI, even among HCWs (32). This may influence health seeking decisions, particularly for women and their children when they come in contact with a male HCW who may exercise undue control over a patient-doctor encounter. This again may have implications for stigma and shame (31). Accordingly, Awad et al. (4) suggest that psychology solutions should consider religiosity."
57,Mental health stigma: a conundrum for healthcare practitioners in conservative communities,"Public stigma is believed to be pervasive and holds the potential to foster negative mind-sets that build long-lasting views that may influence important decisions regarding help seeking behaviors (24?26). However, not only does the stigma around mental health manifest itself in the general population, and therefore, the friends and relatives of sufferers, but HCWs are also implicated in the stigma and shaming of PWMI. This connection is especially significant because these individuals act as gatekeepers to healthcare access, therefore PWMI can face an implicit obstacle to accessing the care they need. Moreover, a health workforce lacking in knowledge or with negatively inclined practitioners will lead to the creation of an environment that is unaccommodating for service users. As such, the resulting unfavorable experiences may discourage the care recipient from asking for assistance (27)."
58,Mental health stigma: a conundrum for healthcare practitioners in conservative communities,"Mental health services across conservative communities in the Gulf region have been receiving increasing support, for example, in Qatar, the launch of the National Mental Health Strategy for Qatar in 2013 led to mental health services transitioning toward more community based care within a more comprehensive and integrated system (19). It is notable that across the Gulf region during the COVID-19 pandemic, technology was increasingly used to support mental health sufferers, such as cloud based big data systems, artificial intelligence and AI chatbots, online health communities, and telehealth platforms, were introduced as a response to the pandemic, paving the way for digital mental health solutions. Therefore, Chew et al. (20) (p. 2) claim that ?digital mental health tools are the silver lining we are fortunate to have, as they can empower responses to the COVID-19 outbreak at a scale that was never before possible in human history.?"
59,Mental health stigma: a conundrum for healthcare practitioners in conservative communities,"The definition of stigma proposed by Goffman (7) posits that stigma is an attribute that devalues a person and sets them aside from others. This definition lays bare the vulnerability of individuals with a disability, especially those with mental health needs. Furthermore, it is well documented in the literature that people with a mental illness (PWMI) face stigma from multiple sources, including schools, hospitals, places of worship and sometimes even from their own families (8,�9). For example, Zolezzi et al. (10) found that the stigma related to mental health in Arab collectivist societies extends beyond the sufferer to the whole family, impacting their reputation; therefore, the stigma and shame around mental health is exacerbated for PWMI due to concerns about the impact on their wider family as well as themselves. Similarly, Andrade et al. (11) explain that in conservative communities where traditional family values and the notion of ?honor? exist, ?mental health issues are more likely to be perceived as threatening the integrity of the family, given that mental health stigma affects the reputation of the family involved? [(11), p. 2]."
60,Mental health stigma: a conundrum for healthcare practitioners in conservative communities,"Encouraging access to mental health support within such conservative communities, where religion, moral and social identity, and the role of the family take precedence, is often difficult (3). This is in part because mental health problems are sometimes viewed as shameful and are, therefore, hidden from friends, family and the workplace (4). Addressing the stigma around mental health is essential to public health provision because it can lead to delays in seeking support, which may exacerbate the condition. In addition, it can have negative consequences not only for sufferers, but also for their families and caregivers, along with poor treatment outcomes due to fears over sharing information about symptoms (5)."
61,Mental health stigma: a conundrum for healthcare practitioners in conservative communities,"This paper presents perspectives on the stigma and shame around mental health in conservative communities, and some of the issues faced by health systems in those communities. The various causes of stigma are explored, and how these are often more pronounced in culturally reserved, conservative communities. While health systems are supposed to provide support for mental health sufferers, this stigma sometimes even extends to healthcare workers, which can discourage patients from asking for assistance. Solutions and reforms are needed, for example education programs; addressing gender norms, and the consideration of culture and religion, to form effective solutions. It is also suggested that alternative therapies and support mechanisms, including digital solutions such as artificial intelligence chatbots, may be useful to provide much needed support to individuals with poor mental health. Along with integrating options such as CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy), it may be useful to draw on indigenous psychologies, such as Islamic psychology, as a way of decolonizing approaches. Therefore, when considering solutions, cultural and religious norms must be considered to ensure their efficacy and acceptance."
62,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"We acknowledge the inherent limitations in our approach, recognizing that our search strategy might have omitted potential data sources not explicitly defined within our predetermined categories. Though our findings verified the significance of multimodality compared to unimodality in most cases, there is no absolute answer since the overall efficacy depends on modality-specific features. In addition, there are risks associated with our assumption that passive sensing captures natural behaviors and is more acceptable. The deliberate exclusion of active sensing based on this assumption limits our understanding of potential insights that active sensing approaches can offer. In conjunction with our previous discussion on seeking validation in ground truth information, active inputs may be valuable and necessary to achieve robust validation. As we critically evaluated each data source, we observed a refutation of our assumption, such that passive sensing approaches can be privacy-invasive and are not necessarily well accepted. This is due to the uncertainties and unobtrusiveness of such approaches, which may introduce a sense of insecurity among individuals from whom the data is collected. Building upon the acknowledgements, the current study has recognized smartphone sensing as a promising avenue for further exploration as our next step forward. In light of the ethical considerations and limitations identified, we plan to conduct interviews and focus groups with individuals with MH disorders to gather feedback on the acceptability of smartphone sensing and potential workarounds for addressing privacy concerns. Simultaneously, consulting healthcare professionals will provide valuable perspectives on incorporating smartphone sensing into clinical practice. As we embark on the journey into smartphone sensing, we extend an open invitation for collaboration with fellow researchers, healthcare professionals, and stakeholders passionate about advancing in this domain."
63,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"6. Assess the significance of ground truth information:�Evaluating the significance of ground truth information informs how researchers gauge its impact on the study and whether specific workarounds are necessary to enhance ground truth reliability and validity during data collection. This evaluation will then aid researchers in designing the data collection procedure and determining the extent of reliance on ground truth to support future analysis, reasoning, and deductions."
64,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"4. Consult stakeholders:�Engaging stakeholders, including healthcare professionals, patients, and families, provides various perspectives of parties involved in supporting individuals with MH disorders. These consultations verify and offer insights into the acceptability and feasibility of data sources and help ensure that researchers? decisions align with ethical considerations and stakeholders? comfort."
65,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"2. Determine the target population:�Identifying the target population and its characteristics involves various aspects, including the targeted MH disorders, demographics, cultural backgrounds, and geographical distribution. These aspects are mutually influential since individuals? behaviors and data may vary based on reactions to different MH disorders, with further influence caused by cultural backgrounds and demographics, such as age, gender, and occupation. Additionally, geographical distribution and economic backgrounds may influence an individual?s accessibility to a specific data collection tool. This consideration ensures that the data collected is representative and applicable to the population of interest, enhancing the overall effectiveness of the approach."
66,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"In light of the various influencing factors of MH conditions and the necessary considerations for high-stakes applications involving vulnerable individuals, we have devised guidelines that future researchers can use in conjunction with�Figure 5�above for selecting an optimal data source or combinations of data sources based on specific use cases."
67,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"However, the integration of smartphone sensing into MH applications demands further research due to several critical considerations that are yet to be addressed. Ethical concerns arise regarding whether it is privacy-infringing for researchers to access individuals? private or personal behaviors, which they may be unwilling to disclose. Consequently, they may deliberately hide or alter their behaviors to ?trick? the data collection system or withdraw due to privacy concerns. These issues contribute to the potential unreliability and sparsity of the resulting data, introducing challenges for technical researchers to seek solutions for data-driven ML algorithms, especially in supervised learning with a heavy reliance on ground truth labels. Despite the rich information in time series sensor-based data, there is still room for research to investigate techniques that fully harness its potential. While existing studies have demonstrated the efficacy of neural network architectures in modeling such high-dimensional data, the low explainability and high complexity of such architectures remain a critical challenge. Additionally, existing elicitation techniques are often informed by standard guidelines like DSM-V, potentially disregarding behaviors yet to be discovered. As such, it is imperative to establish a common ground between researchers and clinical experts that enables collaboration to investigate and interpret ML outputs to ensure clinically relevant outcomes."
68,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"As much as the ability to manage data sharing based on personal comfort can improve the acceptability of data collection, researchers should be aware of the resulting risks of biases and sparsity in data. A reduction in the unobtrusiveness of passive sensing and an increased likelihood of skewness will occur if participants constantly manage their data sharing. There will also be data sparsity issues if participants can selectively activate/deactivate specific sensors at random times. There are other means of establishing people?s trust in researchers to raise their confidence that their shared data will be kept secure and handled cautiously with safety procedures. For example, this can be achieved by offering transparency of what is being collected, why, and how they will be stored and handled."
69,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"We inferred wearable sensing as the most acceptable because it gathers the least identifiable data (e.g., physiological signals like heart rate and skin temperature, activity levels, and sleep patterns) that is most unlikely to disclose people?s personal information. On the other hand, acceptability towards smartphone sensing is debatable. A study [100] discovered GPS to be the most acceptable compared to calendars, call logs, text logs, and contacts, and only one-third of study participants shared their smartphone logs. However, this is not necessarily the case for some with safety concerns about revealing their locations (e.g., not wanting to disclose their homes or concerns over being stalked [317]), and allowing access to call and text logs can also be perceived as privacy-invasive. In both smartphone and wearable sensing contexts, participants may or may not have control over the kinds of data collected from them, i.e., which sensors are enabled, depending on the approach design and configuration by researchers."
70,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"Since most populations generally own smartphones [316], the potential equipment cost for smartphone sensing is lowered. However, a substantial cost might be incurred if researchers are to provide smartphones to study participants without smartphones or to ensure consistency. In contrast, wearable devices are cheaper but less ubiquitous than smartphones since some participants do not see the necessity of possessing wearable devices (e.g., fitness watch, smartwatch) and consider them a luxury item. Though both approaches involve time series sensor signals, which may be high dimensional, the storage cost is still relatively economical compared to multidimensional video files. Nevertheless, we observed a novel application of federated learning in Tabassum et al.?s [168] work, which is potentially feasible for resolving storage and privacy concerns. The authors processed collected data and extracted features locally in individuals? devices to obtain local features and parameters. These were then utilized to fine-tune local individual-specific ML models, which share and exchange higher-level parameters with a global-centric model. This approach significantly lowered transmission cost and storage space since server transmission is reduced from complex multidimensional data to numerical features and parameters while minimizing the risks of privacy leaks during transmission since raw data was discarded after local processing. As such, researchers should consider the factors discussed in�Section 4.1.3�to ensure that ML models residing in local devices are highly deployable, such as being efficient and lightweight, to avoid consuming excessive local processing power."
71,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"We inspected costs in terms of (1) data accessibility, (2) external costs incurred for dedicated data collection equipment and tools, (3) processing power for transforming and analyzing data, and (4) storage space. These considerations are crucial in evaluating the practicality of research outcomes in real-life applications so that a cost-effective method can be easily deployed to benefit the target population."
72,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"Clinical assessments are the only method yielding representative ground truth thus far because self-reports, whether in the form of responses in assessment scales or self-declaration in social media posts, are subject to self-presentation and recall biases. However, we noticed a possibility of verifying ground truth from self-reports by utilizing behaviors detected via smartphone and wearable sensing. These approaches typically request individuals to answer clinically validated assessment scales based on guidelines like the Diagnostic And Statistical Manual Of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V) [315] to serve as baseline ground truth. The response to each assessment question corresponds to recalled behaviors over a specific duration. Taking Wang et al.?s work [150] as inspiration, behaviors inferred from sensor data can be mapped to individual DSM-V symptoms to verify ground-truth labels. Conversely, some researchers primarily rely on social media users? self-identification of MH disorder diagnosis to acquire the ground truth of their MH states, usually through identifying keywords associated with specific MH disorders. Such acquisition risks under-identification since it depends on whether people took the initiative and felt comfortable sharing the information. Solans Noguero et al. [219] further proved that suicide-related lexicons were less comprehensive due to the likelihood of omitting explicit vocabulary and failing to identify implicit hints."
73,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"Both audio-visual recordings and social media data potentially suffer from biases introduced by individuals? self-presentation concerns. For example, a person may behave differently under the pressure of continuous supervision, also known as the Hawthorne effect [314], to look generally appealing or hide any indicative behaviors potentially due to fear of judgment. Similarly, social media users might curate their public posts to appear presentable due to factors like the consciousness of unfavorable public perception or social stigma. In addition, a study [187] found that users express their thoughts differently in the hidden tree hole posts than in usual Sina Microblog posts. A tree hole is a microblog space whose author has committed suicide, and other users tend to comment under the last post of the passed one about their inner feelings and thoughts. Such posts were revealed to contain more self-concern and suicide-related words, thereby challenging the detection of MH through regular or public posts."
74,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"The reliability of a data source relies on how well it captures people?s real-life behaviors. This criterion is crucial to contribute relevant data for supporting clinical diagnosis since failure to reflect realistic behaviors may result in misdiagnosis of MH disorders, potentially leading to severe complications."
75,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"Meanwhile, generalizability improves the transferability of ML models to external scenarios beyond local training environments. Given the potential influence of demographics and personalities on manifestations of MH-related behaviors, existing surveys [17] have highlighted the risks of under-representation of certain groups in training datasets, in which the demographic disparities may be magnified in the subsequent applications to the MH domain. Generalizability can enhance the applicability of ML models to other contexts and heterogeneous populations, subsequently improving the accessibility of the general population to MH resources. As an existing work [312] demonstrated the difficulties of aligning cross-study settings for improved generalizability, Thieme et al. [17] emphasized avoiding overclaiming premature generalization from datasets lacking clinical validation and diversity. As such, future researchers should validate and communicate potential limitations in the generalizability of research outcomes. For example, researchers should account for the diversity within a population by validating outcomes across different subgroups with various demographics and characteristics and reporting on the metadata of the community from which the data is collected."
76,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"While most studies predominantly focused on optimizing performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall, they often overlooked practical considerations for real-world applications of ML models, such as complexity, explainability, and generalizability. Despite the inherent biases in ML algorithms [310], only two included studies examined potential biases at the individual and gender levels. For ML models to be seamlessly integrated into real-time detection applications for clinical use, they must be lightweight in terms of complexity and computational cost, considering that available memory and computation resources may be restricted [311], especially in individuals? local devices. Specifically, in the MH domain, this criterion is significant to enhance efficient computations on the fly and timely delivery of personalized interventions and recommendations without imposing excessive processing power [311]. Ultimately, achieving this can potentially improve individuals? accessibility to mental healthcare resources and subsequently promote their treatment-seeking."
77,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"We could not deduce a single one-size-fits-all model that is the most effective for various multimodal tasks. This is because the effectiveness of ML algorithms relies on the nature and structure of the data, the task to achieve, and how data information is learned and fully utilized. Nonetheless, our observations revealed that ML models adopted in existing studies are primarily supervised learning algorithms, which utilize ground truth as the ?gold standard?, and several models worth investigating are Lasso regression, XGBoost, LSTM-based models, and transformer-based models like XLNet, based on their prominent predictive performance in existing studies. Notably, we noticed a similar trend of rising adoption of NN-based models in recent studies, which appear more valuable than linear statistical algorithms in modeling multidimensional time series signals. As previously discussed in�Section 3.5.2, existing researchers have proposed various novel architectures to incorporate temporal, contextual, and cross-modality dependencies, such as injecting time-based representations into transformer models to improve performance further [129]. We also observed the significance of utilizing relevant data information, where a few studies [111,186] demonstrated that irrelevant textual and visual content introduced noise that obstructs traces of MH disorders and caused further performance deterioration. While the studies above selected more relevant information through techniques like reinforcement learning [111], other studies utilized attention mechanisms to exert significance weights based on relevance instead of eradicating less relevant information. Specifically, attempts [128,146] at hierarchical attention asserted onto deep representations of social media content from word level and subsequently to post and user levels highlighted the great prospect of such mechanisms."
78,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"On the other hand, model-level fusion has been shown in several attempts [69,71,73,308] to generate more effective high-level feature representations than hand-crafted univariate features due to their capability of capturing temporal and contextual dependencies while modeling cross-modality interactions. The decisions of whether to adopt model-level fusion and the architecture to employ should consider the complexity of the research problems. For example, deep NN architectures with more extensive layers may be more effective if researchers are interested in investigating the influence of particular factors across long durations. However, researchers should be aware of the greater computational costs associated with more complex architectures and the black-box nature of certain NN-based architectures, which reduce the interpretability of modeled interactions."
79,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"Based on our categorization of modality fusion techniques, namely feature, score/decision, and model levels, we recommend employing feature or model-level fusion based on researchers? specific use cases. Our observations suggest that score-level fusion might be less effective, as modality features are modeled separately by individual ML algorithms, thereby ignoring the potential correlation of features across different modalities. As previously discussed, certain modalities may be more effective than others in unimodal settings. Since score-level fusion only considers the intermediate prediction outcomes of modality-specific ML models, the more effective modalities may overshadow the less significant ones in the final outcomes, even though all modalities are complementary. The following paragraphs provide more detailed recommendations to decide between feature and model-level fusion."
80,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"Nevertheless, our findings in�Section 3.3.6�highlighted the influence of demographics and personalities on individuals? behaviors, where specific subgroups may openly share their symptoms to seek external support [25], while some may show reluctance through prominent usage of the word ?others? or third-person pronouns on social media [123,187]. Additionally, Shen et al. [109] proved the divergence in Twitter and Sina Microblog user behaviors, where those with depressive behaviors posted less frequently on Twitter, but the opposite trend was observed in Sina Microblog users. There was also a higher occurrence of positive words in textual content in the latter than in the prior. Such disparity in expressivity could be attributed to different populations? cultural and language differences since Sina Microblog users are primarily from Asian countries. Meanwhile, an increased regularity in physical activities could be a coping mechanism for young adults [157] but is not necessarily the case for other contexts or populations having a depressive symptom of lacking interest in activities, as shown in several other studies [110,149,150,152,158]."
81,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"Psychological symptoms related to moods, emotions, and feelings were shown to be effectively captured by textual features, which could be obtained from transcriptions of audio-visual recordings and the content of social media posts. For example, individuals with MH disorders expressed stronger negative emotions via texts with overall negative sentiment or more negative words and emoticons, as well as through MH-specific keywords related to symptoms, treatment, and medications (e.g., antidepressant names and phrases associated with depressive symptoms for depression). While these textual features have been proven indicative, researchers found visual cues to provide complementary information by encapsulating finer details of individuals? implicit inner emotions. For example, the significant association between FAUs and depressive symptoms may indicate how individuals present their facial expressions in response to MH symptoms. In addition, individuals? publicly shared images may reflect their psychological conditions; for instance, preferences for darker colors may represent lower moods, or images of animals may represent self-coping mechanisms to improve emotional states."
82,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"In conjunction with an existing finding that individuals with similar depression scores may portray behavioral differences under similar contexts [156], several researchers attempted to achieve individual personalization by training subject-specific models [164,169,205,207], fine-tuning subject-specific layers [161] in a global NN architecture, and deducing personalized predictions by incorporating information from other samples homogeneous to each individual based on correlation coefficients [156] or demographics [208] such as age [209]."
83,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"Most studies on multimodal detection justified the effectiveness of combining multiple modalities due to their complementary outcomes, which outperformed unimodal approaches. Notably, we noticed a single exception in a finding [174] that textual modality alone is succinctly effective, such that combining it with audio and visual modalities slightly deteriorated the overall performance. Deeper analyses also revealed that specific modalities could be more influential than others. From audio-visual recordings, semantic content in audio transcriptions generated via textual features was found to be more indicative of depression than audio and visual features in several studies on depression, bipolar disorder, and suicidal ideation. Specifically, we found such prominence arising from textual representations using various embedding techniques like GloVe [49], Universal Sentence Encoder [59], Paragraph Vector [102], and ELMo [116]."
84,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"Unlike ensemble learning, MTL involves a single model (of any category mentioned above) trained to solve several simultaneous tasks to exploit task-specific similarities and differences. Examples of task combinations are (1) regression and classification [74,102,118,141,193], (2) depression prediction and emotion recognition [46,106,132], and (3) gender-specific predictions [70]. Though most of the included studies adopted NN-based models, such as CNN [61,62], LSTM [46,106], and DNN architectures [102,193], MTL could also be achieved with linear models, for example, the multi-output support least-squares vector regression (m-SVR) [304] trained to map multivariate inputs to multivariate outputs [207]. Meanwhile, Oureshi et al.?s [70] findings further justified the role of demographics in locating MH disorders, such that incorporating gender prediction as an auxiliary task improved the overall performance."
85,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"Overall, the capabilities of NNs in learning high-dimensional data offer promising effectiveness and flexibility in mental healthcare involving heterogeneous data for capturing multifaceted aspects of MH disorders. Nevertheless, such models require large, high-quality datasets since they can only learn patterns within the training data [290]. Due to the complex and non-linear structure with multiple hidden layers, black-box NNs further introduce challenges in obtaining interpretable explanations of how the algorithms arrive at an output [16,299]."
86,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"Throughout this work, we have observed vast applications and versatilities of NN-based models in feature extraction, modality fusion, and ML prediction, which could be applied directly to multidimensional signals or transformed feature representations. As such, we raise the attention of future researchers to the potential overlapping between the NN-based approaches adopted in the three stages above. For example, the outputs of specific hidden layers in such models applied to raw signals or low-level features could be extracted as high-level feature representations, whereas those from the output layers could be utilized as prediction outcomes. The NN model in such scenarios could then be treated as either a feature extraction technique or an algorithm. The same applies to specific sophisticated architectures proposed to capture cross-modality interactions in model-level fusion, where these networks learn fused representations while simultaneously generating predictions."
87,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"The availability of ground-truth information, obtained via expert annotations or clinical assessments, has enabled the broad application of supervised learning approaches that learn the association between input data and their labels. In our findings, these approaches primarily cater to univariate features, where feature engineering may be required to apply them to multidimensional data. The more popular ML algorithms for supervised learning are linear regression, logistic regression, and support vector machines (SVMs). Based on comparisons conducted in existing studies, stochastic gradient descent [43] and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) regression [200,213] models performed the best in respective investigations on different feature combinations, i.e., the prior on audio, visual and textual features and the latter on wearable sensor signals, but these models are yet to be compared under similar settings. In addition to the traditional or linear algorithms mentioned above, the following subsection discusses a subset of supervised learning approaches utilizing neural networks."

90,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"Previous studies adopted ML models for binary classification on the presence of specific MH disorders, multi-class classification on the stages of MH disorders, and regression on the score based on an assessment scale. A complete overview of these models and their application methods is available in�Appendix C. Referring to an existing study [289], we classified them into:"
91,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"A feature-level fusion is also known as early fusion, where the features of all modalities are concatenated directly before feeding into an ML model. At the score/decision level, instead of features, researchers combined scores/decisions predicted by individual ML models for each modality, such as probabilities, confidence scores, classification labels, or other prediction outcomes, through operations such as AND, OR, product-rule, sum-rule, and majority voting. Fusing these scores would either produce the final outcome or serve as the input to a secondary ML model. There were also hierarchical score/decision-level fusion approaches that aggregate outputs across multiple layers or stages. For example, in Chiu et al.?s [122] user-level depression classification from social media data, the authors first obtained day-based predictions from post-level outputs weighted based on time intervals. Then, they deduced user-level outcomes based on whether day-based predictions fulfilled predefined criteria."
92,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"Some studies further applied transformation on extracted features to prepare for fusion by achieving (1) normalization, (2) dimensionality reduction, and (3) feature alignment. Normalization ensures that numerical features share similar scales and are treated equally by ML models. The most common normalization approaches that we observed are min-max normalization, to scale values between 0 and 1, and z-normalization [288], so that values are zero-mean and unit-variance. Since min-max normalization was claimed to preserve data relationships without reducing outlier effects [56], Cao et al. [187] took this inspiration to represent a subject?s age relative to the maximum age among all subjects in the dataset. Meanwhile, dimensionality reduction approaches were widely adopted, such as principal components analysis (PCA), singular value decomposition (SVD), and factor analysis. Lastly, for feature alignment, researchers transformed feature representations of individual modalities to align their dimensions through whitening (ZCA) transform (sparse coded feature representations) [49], global max pooling [77], or discrete Fourier transform (express visual features in the time?frequency domain) [66]. On the other hand, several other studies adopted neural networks to enforce the exact dimensions of multimodal representations. For example, using fully connected (FC) layers with the same units to condense features to a uniform dimension [70,112,179], a multilayer perceptron (MLP) [111], or bidirectional gated recurrent unit (Bi-GRU) [106] to transform representations to specific dimensions and a custom transformer-based architecture that applies linear projection to match various representation sizes [174]. In addition, an FC layer was also used to embed categorical variables to be concatenated with continuous variables [170]."
93,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"In addition, demographics and personalities might play a role in an individual?s responses to MH disorders. For instance, several studies [25,109] proved that females have a higher tendency to exhibit depressive symptoms than males. Individuals of different genders may also express varying responses to MH disorders to different extents. For instance, Yazdavar et al. [25] found that females expressed depressive symptoms more prominently on social media, implying their strong self-awareness and willingness to share their encounters to seek support. Meanwhile, a study [219] revealed that age, emotions, and the usage of words related to personal concerns are among the most significant indicators for identifying female samples with potential risks of anorexia nervosa, whereas words relating to biological processes were more indicative for male samples. Clinical experts involved in the study further identified gender as one of the most relevant factors to consider in locating anorexia nervosa. Fine-grained visual elements like formant, eye gaze, facial landmarks, and head pose may also vary across genders with depressive symptoms [70]."
94,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"Phone Interaction Features: Phone usage (i.e., inferred from the frequency and duration of screen unlocks) and application usage were potentially helpful. For instance, several studies [158] found a high frequency of screen unlocks and low average unlock duration for each unlock as potential depressive symptoms. However, while Wang et al. [205] demonstrated the association between negative MH states and lower phone usage, the opposite trend was observed in students and adolescents with depressive symptoms who used smartphones longer [150,162,164]. Researchers also investigated more fine-grained features, such as phone usage at different times of the day, where they found schizophrenic patients exhibiting less phone usage at night but more in the afternoon [206]. Additionally, individuals with MH disorders also showed distinctive application engagement, such as Opoku Asare et al.?s [166] findings that individuals with depressive symptoms used social applications more frequently and for a longer duration. Generally, they also showed more active application engagement in the early hours or midnight compared to healthy controls, who showed diluted engagement patterns throughout the day. Meanwhile, Choudhary et al. [212] revealed that individuals with anxiety exhibited more frequent usage of applications from ?passive information consumption apps?, ?games?, and ?health and fitness? categories."
95,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"Smartphone sensor data could be utilized to gain an understanding of individuals? mobility (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope, GPS data), sociability (e.g., call logs, text messaging logs, usage of social applications), and environmental context (e.g., ambient light and sound, wireless WiFi and Bluetooth connections). More personalized insights could be obtained by utilizing location semantics; grouping mobile applications into social, engagement, and entertainment categories; and detecting periodicity and routines to infer individuals? behaviors and routines. Wearable devices further complement smartphone sensor data by offering sleep inferences and physiological signals like heart rate, skin temperature, and calories. Research attempts have uncovered potentially significant indicators of the presence or severity of MH disorders, which we explained in detail in the following paragraphs revolving around three primary aspects, i.e., physical mobility, phone interactions, and sociability."
96,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"Research attempts have demonstrated a significant association between time spent on social media platforms [116] and depressive symptoms. This claim is supported by compelling evidence indicating that a substantial proportion of individuals with depression (76% [130]) and suicidal intent (73% [188]) engaged in more active posting activities on various social media platforms, including Instagram [125], Twitter [20,118], Reddit [130,188], and Weibo [189], particularly at midnight. Some authors [20,118,134] intuited this behavior as potentially linked to sleeping problems or insomnia. The corresponding posts by these individuals were also found to receive less engagement and attention, such as likes, retweets, and favorites [122,137]. Nevertheless, researchers observed contradicting trends in posting behaviors. While a few studies [122,125,137,189] revealed that those with MH disorders were generally less active on Twitter and Instagram, the opposite was observed in other studies on Twitter [121] and Sina Microblog [109]. Such disparities could be attributed to different user populations or sampling periods that may influence social behaviors on these platforms. Other potentially depressive behaviors include less disclosure of personal information [123], a greater likelihood of modifying images before posting [220], and lower preferences for sharing location [122]."
97,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"In contrast, specific keywords could be indicative, such as references to personal events like ?work pressure?, ?divorce?, and ?break up? [118]; biological processes like ?eat?, ?blood?, and ?pain? [116]; or family references like ?daughter?, ?dad?, and ?aunt? [184]. Existing studies also revealed keywords or phrases related to specific MH conditions to be helpful. For example, in depression detection, researchers [54] identified prominent usage of words associated with depressive symptoms, such as ?depressed?, ?hopeless?, and ?worthless?, referenced from the Depression Vocabulary Word List�https://myvocabulary.com/word-list/depression-vocabulary/�(accessed on 10 December 2023), as well as antidepressant names [123] based on the list from Wikipedia�https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_antidepressants�(accessed on 10 December 2023). Nevertheless, MH-related keywords may be expressed differently for various MH disorders. For instance, individuals with schizophrenia used more words related to perception (hear, see, feel), swearing, and anger [204], while T�bar et al. [217] found individuals with an eating disorder (ED) publishing less ED-related content, involving fewer indicative terms like ?laxative names? and ?weight concerns?, to keep their illness private. The latter study demonstrated false positives introduced by such disparities, as healthy controls were involved in discussions of MH disorders like PTSD or depression that share some ED symptoms or mentioned prevalent topics in the pro-ED community."
98,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"In addition to textual content written by individuals, researchers also obtained textual transcripts from audio samples using speech-to-text tools on Google Cloud Platform, AWS Transcribe [277], or Transcriber-AG�https://transag.sourceforge.net/�(accessed on 10 December 2023). Tools like Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) [278], Suite of Automatic Linguistic Analysis Tools (SALAT) [279], and Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) [280] were adopted on textual content to identify nouns, adjectives, pronouns, or specific words referring to social processes and psychological states, where linguistic features were generated as the occurrence of words in specific categories. Meanwhile, sentiment-related features like sentiment polarity scores were obtained from sentiment analysis tools, including Stanford NLP toolkit [281], Sentiment Analysis and Cognition Engine (SEANCE) [282], and Affective Norms for English Words ratings (ANEW) [283]. High-level textual representations could also be obtained via language models, such as BERT [266], Paragraph Vector (PV) [284], and XLNet [285], to represent each word using a vector. The overall textual representations could be obtained via concatenating directly, averaging, or applying attention mechanisms on word-level representations to emphasize more significant features."
99,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"In addition, facial appearance and emotions in shared images were significantly indicative of depression and PTSD [107,116]. While a few studies [25,132,220] showed that individuals with depression have lower tendencies to disclose facial identity, Gui et al. [111] found that they are more likely to post images with faces but of a lower average face count per image. From the revelation of more images of animals and health objects from Twitter and Reddit content, Uban et al. [128] hypothesized the possibility of individuals? online help-seeking through viewing animal-related content that might improve psychological and emotional conditions and looking up causes of health events, diseases, and treatment options."
100,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"Visual features were extracted by first locating individuals or objects in a video frame or a static image, identifying the corresponding feature points (e.g., facial landmarks, FAUs, upper body points), and then generating features using image processing tools including OpenFace [269], OpenCV [270], and OpenPose [271]. Pre-trained models could also be applied directly to visual samples to extract feature representations. For image frames extracted from video recordings, researchers could further capture dynamic aspects and transitions across a video, such as computing the speed and range of displacements of specific feature points between successive video frames and the variation across the entire video."
101,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,A range of modality-specific features within the datasets analyzed by researchers were found to support the identification of MH-related features in study participants.�Table 6�provides a summary of these features and their findings relevant to MH diagnosis. See�Appendix A�for a more extensive view of the features and the corresponding extraction tools.
102,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"In most cases where social media data has been scraped from public-facing platforms via application programming interfaces, users are not reachable due to security and privacy protection. As such, their MH states are not immediately acquirable since they do not usually disclose invasive information like medical history. Researchers have relied on textual or visual cues in users? public posts to locate the existence of MH disorders for the purposes of ground truth. They detected self-reports where users explicitly disclosed being diagnosed with a specific MH disorder in their public posts by looking for sentence structure such as ?I am diagnosed with?? [20]."
103,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"During clinical diagnoses, trained psychiatrists use clinically validated assessment scales with known symptoms of specific MH disorders to prompt patients to share their experiences. Establishing ground-truth knowledge varies based on experimental design in existing studies, where trained healthcare professionals could conduct clinical assessments before the data collection procedure and during other intermediate phases deemed necessary. For example, Gr�nerbl et al.?s [12] study involved psychologists conducting examinations every three weeks over the phone, using standard scale tests such as the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) or Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), whereas participants were scheduled for monthly face-to-face clinical assessments with clinicians using the 7-item Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) in Wang et al.?s [206] study. On the other hand, participants could be recruited from the MH service within a hospital setting, where existing diagnoses of specific MH conditions are known, and clinical assessments could be reconducted during follow-ups and after discharge using the YMRS [230]."
104,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,Table 5�describes publicly available datasets discovered or released by studies included in this work for multimodal detection.
105,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"Prior to data collection, researchers obtained participants? consent and provided details about the data to be collected. Some researchers additionally conducted onboarding sessions for installing mobile applications, offered tutorials to operate them, and provided technical support throughout the data gathering duration [237]. Privacy measures were also implemented to minimize identifiability and the risks of data leakage during transmission, such as anonymizing participants, hashing phone calls and text messaging logs [237], and employing secure transmission protocols like HTTPS and SSL."
106,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"Nevertheless, we observed limited ethical considerations and explicit mentions in existing studies regarding obtaining participants? consent for utilizing their data for research purposes. For example, Yates et al. [231] discussed the privacy risks with posts crawled from Reddit as minimal since this data is publicly available on the platform. The researchers also described their privacy measures for ensuring that annotators and other researchers were only allowed access to anonymized posts after agreeing to adhere to the ethical guidelines for not attempting to contact or deanonymize data samples."
107,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"Audio and video recordings of individuals were captured using video cameras, webcams, or microphones while they responded to interview questions or completed predetermined tasks in person or online. For example, Gratch et al. [228] conducted semi-structured interviews with individual participants with both neutral questions and those related to depression or PTSD events, which the authors recorded using a camera and close-talking microphone. In contrast, NEMSI (NEurological and Mental health Screening Instrument) [229] was proposed as a cloud-based system that automates data capture and the subsequent audio-visual processing for feature extraction and visualization. Before commencing the interviews, researchers [228,230] ensured that participants signed consent forms to collect highly identifiable recording data and share their data for research purposes. The researchers also offered transparency regarding the purpose of their study and data collection before participants provided their consent."

After querying the selected databases, we re-evaluated the title, abstract, and keywords of individual studies to refine the results and remove duplicates. Subsequently, we manually applied the eligibility criteria to determine relevant studies for data extraction."
111,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"Since our work explicitly emphasizes multimodality to observe cross-modality fusion and interactions, we excluded studies emphasizing a single modality. For example, we do not consider those solely analyzing textual content from social media sources (e.g., Twitter) without incorporating broader online social behaviors, such as posting time distribution and interactions with other users through retweets and comments. Additionally, we omitted studies involving children, as it is well-established that factors, manifestations, and responses to MH conditions can differ significantly between children and adults [40]. Children may also often rely on parents and family environment for care and treatment [41,42]."

Our preliminary observation revealed 2015 as a potential juncture where relevant studies began gaining momentum, coinciding with the introduction of AVEC 2013 [37] and AVEC 2014 [38] challenges focusing on facial expressions and vocal cues relating to specific MH conditions such as depression. We intended to ensure that our review encompasses more recent advancements for a comprehensive understanding of the field?s current state. In addition, the rapid development of technologies may render techniques from older publications obsolete or less relevant. Likewise, the relevance of findings related to smartphones and wearable devices may have evolved due to changes in their adoption among the general population over time."
120,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"We queried the databases by combining keywords within the same category with an OR operator and those across categories with an AND operator. We also considered different terminology variants by using wildcards (*), for instance, ?well*? in our query string, because the term ?wellbeing? may be spelled as ?well-being? in certain studies.

123,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,RQ1?Which sources of passive sensing data are most effective for supporting the detection of MH disorders?
124,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"The pipeline of ML methodologies on multimodal data includes feature extraction for each modality, transformation and fusion of modality-specific features of various structures and dimensions and ML algorithms to learn from fused representations. Our preliminary investigation of recent surveys of ML applications to multimodal MH detection revealed several data sources, such as social media [22,23,24,25], smartphones [26,27], and wearable devices [27,28]. Nevertheless, we observed a limited evaluation of the current state of knowledge in each methodological phase mentioned above, in which the understanding is crucial to inform advancements in ML approaches. In summary, the gaps we identified are the need for (1) more effective ML approaches to reduce the risk of underdiagnosis and (2) ML methodologies for handling heterogeneous and extensive multimodal data to support the detection of multifaceted MH disorders."
125,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"Despite the prevalence, several shortcomings exist in the current diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders. These include comorbidities with other conditions that introduce complexity to diagnosis [11], the subsequent failure of clinicians to make accurate diagnoses due to obscurities of overlapping symptoms [11], the reliance on patients? subjective recollection of behaviors [12], and the shortage of human resources available for mental health care [13]. The limitations above contribute to underdiagnosis, preventing people in need from receiving proper treatment. In light of the need to promote more accurate detection of MH disorders, researchers began exploring the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) in this domain. Such efforts are motivated by the ability of ML to analyze large amounts of data [14], distinguish data features [15], learn meaningful relationships between data [16], and apply the identified associations to make predictions about new data [17]. Coupling ML methods with qualitative analysis, visualization, and other interpretation tools further enhances the understanding of ML outputs [17], which can support clinical decisions and improve the comprehension of causes of specific MH disorders."
126,Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches,"As mental health (MH) disorders become increasingly prevalent, their multifaceted symptoms and comorbidities with other conditions introduce complexity to diagnosis, posing a risk of underdiagnosis. While machine learning (ML) has been explored to mitigate these challenges, we hypothesized that multiple data modalities support more comprehensive detection and that non-intrusive collection approaches better capture natural behaviors. To understand the current trends, we systematically reviewed 184 studies to assess feature extraction, feature fusion, and ML methodologies applied to detect MH disorders from passively sensed multimodal data, including audio and video recordings, social media, smartphones, and wearable devices. Our findings revealed varying correlations of modality-specific features in individualized contexts, potentially influenced by demographics and personalities. We also observed the growing adoption of neural network architectures for model-level fusion and as ML algorithms, which have demonstrated promising efficacy in handling high-dimensional features while modeling within and cross-modality relationships. This work provides future researchers with a clear taxonomy of methodological approaches to multimodal detection of MH disorders to inspire future methodological advancements. The comprehensive analysis also guides and supports future researchers in making informed decisions to select an optimal data source that aligns with specific use cases based on the MH disorder of interest."
127,Describing the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health and Applying It to a Generative AI Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Platform: Tutorial,"While the framework provides a comprehensive approach to evaluating AI tools in mental health, it has certain limitations, including the need for continuous updates to keep pace with rapidly evolving AI technologies and the challenge of ensuring consistent application across diverse mental health contexts. It underscores the urgent need for industry regulation and standardized self-evaluation practices, as the current landscape of emerging AI technologies in mental health lacks sufficient oversight to ensure user privacy, safety, and equitable access to quality care."
128,Describing the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health and Applying It to a Generative AI Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Platform: Tutorial,"The path from developing the framework to its widespread adoption in practice involves complex challenges. Future research should explore how this tool can be integrated into the decision-making processes of mental health professionals, health care organizations, and technology developers. This may involve investigating methods to make framework-based evaluations readily accessible within existing clinical workflows, as well as studying how the framework can inform best practice guidelines in the field. By demonstrating its utility in improving patient care and safety, the framework could grow to become a valued standard in the mental health AI landscape, potentially helping shape how professionals and patients engage with these emerging technologies. To facilitate the adoption and application of FAITA-Mental Health, a quick start guide is provided in�Multimedia Appendix 2, offering step-by-step guidance for evaluating mental health GenAI tools."
129,Describing the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health and Applying It to a Generative AI Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Platform: Tutorial,"Finally, OCD Coach at first provided high-level, lengthy, and potentially overwhelming psychoeducational overviews when Sam asked for assistance with OCD. Only when Sam inquired about a personalized, collaborative approach did OCD Coach offer to walk her through a more manageable, stepwise process. This underscores the need for AI-based interventions that not only present users with longer-term comprehensive care synopses, but also actionable and approachable guidance. This observation may form part of a third subdomain of the user empowerment domain in a future version of FAITA-Mental Health."
130,Describing the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health and Applying It to a Generative AI Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Platform: Tutorial,"With regard to crisis response, when Sam reported suicidal ideation, OCD Coach directed her to emergency services or a crisis hotline ?in [her] area? [32]. While this response technically warrants a 1 according to the current safety and crisis management domain criteria (?Displays basis safety or crisis management features?) and does not correspond to a 0 (?Lacks safety protocols or crisis management features?), it lacks the hyper localized specificity that would be most useful to someone experiencing an acute crisis. In particular, individuals with low health literacy who are experiencing a mental health crisis may not have the cognitive wherewithal to navigate beyond the AI app?s interface to identify relevant resources. This could diminish utility and delay or hinder access to help, potentially posing safety risks. It is, therefore, recommended that the criteria associated with a score of 0 on the safety and crisis management domain be changed to ?Lacks�specific, local�safety protocols or crisis management features.?"
131,Describing the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health and Applying It to a Generative AI Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Platform: Tutorial,"It is unclear from the tool, its website, or its LinkedIn page whether clinical guidance was involved in the development process. When Sam asked whether clinical input was involved, the GPT responded that it did not have specific details, instead recommending that ?It would be best to consult the official resources or contact the developers directly? [32]. Somewhat ironically, when Sam asked whether clinical input was involved in OCD Coach?s development, she was informed, ?In the development of tools like OCD Coach, clinical input or leadership from professionals in the mental health field is typically essential. Typically, a clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or other mental health professionals specializing in obsessive-compulsive disorder would be involved to provide expertise and ensure that the content is therapeutically appropriate and effective.? [32] In the original One Mind PsyberGuide rating system, a clinical input in development subdomain was included within the credibility domain [27], with a score of 1 corresponding to a ?Clinical leader with mental health expertise involved in development,? and a score of 0 to ?No clinical leader with mental health expertise involved in development.? The next FAITA-Mental Health iteration may benefit from adding a fourth subdomain, clinical input in development, within domain 1: credibility."

133,Describing the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health and Applying It to a Generative AI Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Platform: Tutorial,"While the response was reasonably empathic and encouraged Sam to connect with a crisis hotline or emergency services, no specific numbers or links were provided in this hypothetical acute crisis. Therefore, OCD Coach would score a 1 on this subdomain, as it offers general recommendations but no local resources. This observation will be further explored in the section below to further advance the framework?s assessment capabilities."
134,Describing the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health and Applying It to a Generative AI Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Platform: Tutorial,"The authors grant OCD Coach a score of 1 on this subdomain because while the tool provides details upon request, it does not offer full, immediate, and proactive disclosure. The initial screen only discloses the name of the developer without comprehensive information about the team, ownership, funding sources, business model, training and development approaches, and primary beneficiaries, which can limit access for users who may not know how to probe for such information. In addition, directing users to the BuildBetter home page for more information by OCD Coach through a link provided in its response can increase friction and potentially impact retention negatively."

137,Describing the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health and Applying It to a Generative AI Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Platform: Tutorial,"Given that OCD Coach did not explore cultural diversity variables, communicated above the average national reading level [36], and made suggestions that may not have incorporated Sam?s socioeconomic reality or cultural identity, OCD Coach earns a score of 0 on this subdomain."
138,Describing the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health and Applying It to a Generative AI Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Platform: Tutorial,"As discussed in domain 2: user experience, subdomain 2: quality of interactions, OCD Coach?s utterances were characteristically lengthy, which could be problematic for readers who prefer brevity or have low literacy levels. In addition, when the authors verified the readability score via Microsoft Word?s readability scoring feature, OCD Coach?s utterances merited a score of 10.8 on the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Test [35], correlating with scores which are 3 to 4 levels above the average national reading level [36]. Given Sam?s lower socioeconomic status and assuming that she has a sixth-grade reading level, some of the AI recommendations for exposure exercises, such as rearranging books on a shelf, may not have been appropriate, as it is unclear whether she would possess books."

(2) ?Strategy for dealing with OCD in social settings,? (3) ?What?s happening in my brain with these thoughts?? and (4) ?How to explain my OCD to others?? [32]. These are presented again when the user elects to begin chatting. After Sam asked for ERP coaching, OCD Coach inquired whether she wished to discuss how to handle a specific scenario or needed further guidance on any of these steps. While it mostly responded to Sam?s questions, it did not present many choices. However, it did encourage ERP on multiple occasions, including suggesting exposure exercises that would take place beyond the app. OCD Coach, thus, occasionally presents choices and recommends that a user engage in an intervention (ERP) that entails practice beyond the platform. However, it does not offer such choices consistently, and when it does, choices are more generic rather than based on an exploration of the individual user?s needs and goals. OCD Coach would thus receive a score of 1 on this subdomain."
140,Describing the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health and Applying It to a Generative AI Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Platform: Tutorial,Sam?s efforts to use the stated user autonomy features such as setting data sharing preferences or deleting personal data were met with the program suggesting generic steps that did not apply directly to OCD Coach or with circular recommendations that did not result in clear information. This discrepancy highlighted a gap between the purported data protection measures and the practical ability of users to manage privacy and data.
141,Describing the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health and Applying It to a Generative AI Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Platform: Tutorial,"Sam inquired whether specific data protection measures existed, and OCD Coach stated that robust security protocols and user control mechanisms were in place. However, when Sam requested access to the privacy policy and to adjust her data preferences, the instructions were vague and nonspecific to OCD Coach. Attempts to find more detailed information or contact support via an advertised OCD Coach website led nowhere, as searches only redirected in a circular manner to the OCD Coach GPT web landing page within the OpenAI website. Sam then asked OCD Coach more directly as to how she could modify her personal data and sharing preferences. In its response, OCD Coach mentioned accessing such features via an app. When Sam inquired how to access this app, OCD Coach recommended searching for ?OCD Coach? in the app store relevant to Sam?s device. Similar to Sam?s experience with searching for a dedicated OCD Coach website, there was no OCD Coach app found in Sam?s Apple App Store. Confusingly, OCD Coach noted, ?If you encounter any difficulties, the support or help section of the app or website usually provides further assistance? [32]. As Sam was able to locate neither an OCD Coach?specific website nor an app, this advice was of limited value."
142,Describing the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health and Applying It to a Generative AI Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Platform: Tutorial,"While OCD Coach does appear to provide authentic empathy in some interactions, such as its response to Sam?s disclosure around suicidal ideation (see domain 6: Safety and Crisis Management below), as well as in other instances (eg, ?It sounds like you?re dealing with some challenging symptoms of OCD?) [32], its utterances are typically multiple paragraphs long or in the form of extensive lists. These responses are disproportionate in length to user utterances, detracting from a more natural, equal exchange. Long-winded responses, while perhaps intended to maximize psychoeducation, may be experienced as one-sided and overwhelming. As a result, OCD Coach would receive a score of 1 regarding the quality of its interactions."

145,Describing the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health and Applying It to a Generative AI Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Platform: Tutorial,"On the first screen, OCD Coach is introduced as a ?scientific and empathetic CBT assistant for OCD.? In response to Sam?s presenting concern, OCD Coach appropriately recommended exposure and response prevention (ERP), the gold standard for nonpharmacological intervention in OCD care [33] and correctly explained what it involved. In addition, OCD Coach recommended setting specific limits (eg, using a timer to limit time spent on tasks), mindfulness and acceptance techniques, creating a structured routine, seeking support from others, and finding a therapist to guide her through ERP and other ?tailored strategies? [32]. It should be noted that as part of the social support recommendations, OCD Coach encouraged Sam to ?connect with online forums where you can share your experiences and learn from others facing similar situations? [32], potentially exposing her to the risk of environments not monitored by an OCD specialist or without guidelines in place, which could perpetuate compulsions (eg, reassurance-seeking) and misinformation."
146,Describing the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health and Applying It to a Generative AI Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Platform: Tutorial,"The authors deliberately kept the inputted utterance relatively short for optimal realism, as well as to assess the ability of OCD Coach to seek more information about Sam and tailor the intervention along relevant subdomains such as personalization and cultural inclusivity."
147,Describing the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health and Applying It to a Generative AI Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Platform: Tutorial,"A case study helps illustrate how FAITA-Mental Health can be systematically applied to evaluate a mental health GenAI product that is widely available. Demonstrating how the framework can be applied would not only show its practical utility in everyday clinical settings but could also provide developers and other stakeholders with a more concrete and pragmatic way to assess the relevance of important AI concepts highlighted. Given the authors? clinical expertise in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and many patient questions that they have fielded about the use of AI-mediated tools in its treatment, the decision was made to apply FAITA-Mental Health to an OCD GenAI platform via the use of a hypothetical patient scenario. As a proxy for accessibility, the first tool that appeared when searching for ?OCD? in OpenAI?s GPT store was selected [32]. This tool was named OCD Coach."
148,Describing the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health and Applying It to a Generative AI Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Platform: Tutorial,"The integration of safety and crisis management protocols and features into mental health GenAI interventions is vital, ensuring that they are not only evidence-informed, user-friendly, and culturally inclusive but also safe, with users directed to appropriate resources in crisis situations and with optimized follow-through."
149,Describing the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health and Applying It to a Generative AI Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Platform: Tutorial,"Within the context of mental health GenAI tools, transparency is vital for establishing trust, accountability, and ethical integrity. This domain transcends data handling policies and practices captured in the user autonomy, data protection, and privacy subdomain of the user experience domain to include important elements such as ownership, funding sources, business model, development methodologies, and key beneficiaries. This broader spectrum of transparency, which diverges from One Mind PsyberGuide?s original components, arises from the unique challenges and considerations that mental health GenAI technologies introduce. This domain now focuses more squarely on the operational and business aspects of mental health GenAI tool development, while concerns related to user data security and privacy are addressed separately in the user autonomy, data protection, and privacy subdomain previously described. By adding this distinction, the new framework stresses the dual priorities of verifying that users? sensitive mental health data are safeguarded while emphasizing the industry?s responsibilities to uphold high standards in development and deployment."
150,Describing the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health and Applying It to a Generative AI Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Platform: Tutorial,"The subdomain cultural sensitivity and inclusivity is designed to evaluate a mental health GenAI tool?s ability to engage users from diverse backgrounds respectfully and competently. It underlines content, imagery, and interaction strategies that acknowledge cultural, identity, socioeconomic, and other demographic differences. A maximum score of 2 signifies that the mental health GenAI tool displays definite efforts to integrate cultural diversity and inclusivity within its interactions, which may be substantiated by either positive user feedback, public documentation, or both. A score of 1 suggests that while there are some apparent efforts toward cultural inclusivity, these may be limited in their scope or depth. A score of 0 indicates little to no evidence of consideration for cultural diversity or inclusivity in the mental health GenAI tool?s interactions."
151,Describing the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health and Applying It to a Generative AI Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Platform: Tutorial,"The second subdomain in the new user agency domain is user empowerment, which assesses the degree to which the mental health GenAI tool enables a sense of user self-efficacy. This subdomain measures the extent to which the AI tool empowers users, encouraging adaptive, healthy self-management and independent functioning rather than fostering maladaptive, dysfunctional, or unhealthy reliance on the AI. A score of 2 is allocated to mental health GenAI tools that promote strong user empowerment, actively minimizing potential dependency on the tool by providing ?offline? resources and techniques that foster self-efficacy in mental health management. They create digital environments in which users are encouraged to make informed choices regarding the intervention pathways that are aligned with their personally held goals, needs, and preferences. A score of 1 is conferred upon the mental health GenAI tools that include elements of user empowerment such as choice in technique and encouragement of real-life application of skill, although these may be limited or not fully realized. A score of 0 suggests that the tool lacks substantial efforts to empower users, omitting crucial opportunities to support active mental health management and failing to urge users to apply skills learned in a digital context to their everyday lives."
152,Describing the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health and Applying It to a Generative AI Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Platform: Tutorial,"Besides control over personal health data, the user autonomy, data protection, and privacy subdomain encompasses data protection and privacy standards including robust encryption and secure data storage mechanisms combined with explicit user consent processes obtained through concise, clear, and user-friendly language. This approach seeks to maximize user understanding of and trust in how personal data are managed, clarifying confidentiality protections and limitations."
153,Describing the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health and Applying It to a Generative AI Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Platform: Tutorial,"While using AI-powered mental health tools, user agency is essential to ensure that users maintain control over personal data and care pathways, engendering a sense of empowerment, security, and trust in the technology supporting their mental health journey. The new user agency domain is split into 2 subdomains: user autonomy, data protection, and privacy and user empowerment."
154,Describing the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health and Applying It to a Generative AI Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Platform: Tutorial,"The addition of an interactivity quality subdomain scrutinizes the appropriateness and naturalness of an AI mental health tool?s responses within complex conversational dynamics. The quality of interactions, including factors such as how natural, meaningful, and contextually fitting the responses are, may significantly influence user experience, ultimately affecting retention and therapeutic outcome. Assigning a score for this subdomain involves awarding a maximum of 2 points on a scale from 0 to 2, with 2 indicating consistently natural interactions that are contextually appropriate and supportive of users? needs. A score of 1 signifies that while some interactions display naturalness and contextual appropriateness, this is not consistent. A score of 0 refers to an intervention that routinely fails to deliver natural or contextually appropriate interactions."
155,Describing the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health and Applying It to a Generative AI Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Platform: Tutorial,"Given that AI-powered mental health tools typically involve more complex and sensitive interactions than static mental health apps, the user experience domain of One Mind PsyberGuide was lacking in certain measures. Specifically, apart from subdomains such as engagement (the degree of interest and customization in an app), functionality (user-friendliness, navigability, intuitiveness) and esthetics (visual design appeal), it was essential to also assess new subdomains contributing to user experience in AI tools, specifically personalization and evolution, interactivity quality, and feedback mechanism and support."
156,Describing the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health and Applying It to a Generative AI Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Platform: Tutorial,"The evidence-based content subdomain assesses the degree to which an intervention is built on research-backed principles and leverages practices supported by current research and established methodologies. A score of 2 signifies the exclusive use of evidence-based content, fully grounded in current research data. A score of 1 shows a mixture of evidence-based and nonevidence-based content, indicating some effort to ground the product in evidence, albeit inconsistently. A score of 0 reflects a lack of evidence-based content."
157,Describing the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health and Applying It to a Generative AI Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Platform: Tutorial,"The credibility domain is integral to evaluating AI-powered mental health tools and focuses on the scientific foundation for these interventions and how they can meet their stated goals. This domain assesses the degree to which mental health GenAI tools articulate clear mental health goals, base their content on evidence-based practices, and maintain user engagement over time through high retention rates. It comprises 3 subdomains, 2 adapted from One Mind PsyberGuide (proposed goal and evidence-based content) and 1 newly added (retention)."
158,Describing the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health and Applying It to a Generative AI Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Platform: Tutorial,"Together, the FAITA-Mental Health components attempt to cover both the promising and compromising aspects of GenAI tools in mental health, aiming to create a framework that advances ?best practices? by helping guide effective, safe, and inclusive clinical use and responsible industry development."
159,Describing the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health and Applying It to a Generative AI Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Platform: Tutorial,"The addition of the user agency domain reflects the need for augmented user control over personal health data and care pathways in AI-driven interventions. The equity and inclusivity domain addresses the imperative for cultural sensitivity and bias mitigation in AI systems, which can unfortunately perpetuate or exacerbate existing health disparities if they are not designed carefully. The safety and crisis management domain recognizes the potential risks related to non?clinician-guided AI interactions in mental health contexts. New subdomains, such as personalization and evolution and interactivity quality have been integrated to assess the complexity of AI-human dialogue and the dynamic nature of AI interactions. The feedback mechanism and support subdomain acknowledges the indispensability of user input in refining AI systems, a core component of responsible AI development in health care."
160,Describing the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health and Applying It to a Generative AI Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Platform: Tutorial,"FAITA-Mental Health draws inspiration from One Mind PsyberGuide, an early not-for-profit project that assessed pre-GenAI digital mental health tools based on 3 domains: credibility, user experience, and transparency [26,27]. Its catalog of vetted mobile apps was well received by several constituencies. In their paper on mobile health apps for the pediatric age group, for example, Psihogios et al [28] lauded One Mind PsyberGuide?s credibility, user experience, and transparency metrics. Nesamoney [29] endorsed it for helping app developers ?better understand what makes a good mHealth app.? Garland et al [30] considered it superior to other app review platforms, including those by the American Psychological Association and the Anxiety and Depression Association of America. It possessed certain advantages compared with the popular American Psychiatric Association?s App Advisor, such as an inventory of short reviews by users and lengthier ones by mental health experts. In addition, for each domain and subdomain, One Mind PsyberGuide offered scoring guidelines, a feature not included in App Advisor. Unfortunately, even as it became a trusted resource, PsyberGuide ceased operations for lack of funding [26]. Given the crucial task of GenAI tools ?learning? from continuous user feedback and of scoring guidelines that can allow better comparisons, One Mind PsyberGuide?s approach provides a sensible foundation."
161,Describing the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health and Applying It to a Generative AI Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Platform: Tutorial,"These attempts to generate or produce assessment methods of AI tools underscores the requirement for a comprehensive evaluative framework?one that can ?keep up? with the dynamic, evolving nature of mental health GenAI platforms and recognizes their unique potential, risks, and complexities. To help address this need, we have introduced FAITA-Mental Health scale (Multimedia Appendix 1), incorporating domains and subdomains that collectively attempt a global evaluation of AI-driven mental health tools [25]."
162,Describing the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health and Applying It to a Generative AI Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Platform: Tutorial,"Abbasian et al [15] have suggested a structured approach and specific metrics for evaluating GenAI health care conversations without explicitly tailoring them to mental health. Specifically, their approach evaluates the accuracy, trustworthiness, empathy, and computing performance of GenAI interactions. In a newsmagazine article, the AI scholar Lance Eliot has highlighted the importance of evaluating GenAI chatbots based on their degree of autonomy [16] understood as level of independence from human oversight. Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perpetuate harmful biases [1,17-20], and therefore, Pfohl et al [21] have stressed the need to systematically assess this important risk."
163,Describing the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health and Applying It to a Generative AI Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Platform: Tutorial,"Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) refers to artificial intelligence (AI) systems capable of creating new content such as text, images, or conversational responses based on patterns learned from large datasets. GenAI may herald a paradigmatic shift in mental health care, offering the potential for accessible, scalable, and individualized services that can help remedy provider shortages and other obstacles to accessing care [1-6]. Meanwhile, an automated AI-driven treatment future strikes fear in many and raises unprecedented challenges. While GenAI in mental health care offers potential benefits such as increased accessibility and personalized interventions, it also raises concerns about privacy, accuracy, and ethical implications of AI-driven therapeutic interactions."
164,Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Suicidal Thinking in Adolescents by Derivation and Validation in 3 Independent Worldwide Cohorts: Algorithm Development and Validation Study,"In addressing the pressing global concern of adolescent suicide, this study used ML to offer novel insights into preemptive detection. By integrating diverse data sets across 3 nations, the study highlighted the superiority of the XGBoost model in predicting suicidal thinking, achieving remarkable AUROCs of 90.06% (95% CI 89.97-90.16; KYRBS from South Korea; discovery), 83.09% (YRBS from the United States; extra validation), and 81.27% (Ungdata from Norway; extra validation). Our findings emphasize the significant role of emotional health indicators in predicting suicidal thinking among adolescents. Specifically, sadness and despair proved to be the most influential predictors, followed by stress status and age. Through our robust, cross-culturally validated model and its accessibility through web-based platforms, we underscore the potential for timely interventions and offer a promising blueprint for future mental health strategies and preventive measures for at-risk adolescents."
165,Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Suicidal Thinking in Adolescents by Derivation and Validation in 3 Independent Worldwide Cohorts: Algorithm Development and Validation Study,"Despite these limitations, the strengths of this study are manifold. Notably, the SHAP value analysis highlights the importance of diverse demographic and behavioral indicators in understanding suicidal thinking among adolescents. This study provides nuanced insight into each feature?s unique influence and the model?s decision-making process [29]. The robustness of the model is also noteworthy, as evidenced by its uniform effectiveness across data sets spanning South Korea, the United States, and Norway. Such wide-reaching efficacy suggests the adaptability of the model to different cultural and demographic landscapes. Another strength lies in the real-world applicability of our research. The development of our advanced web-based platform and mobile interface marks a notable advancement in practical application. By offering a user-friendly interface tailored for both desktop and mobile users, we enhance accessibility and promote greater self-awareness about suicidal risk. This can encourage individuals to seek timely professional assistance or supportive resources, serving as a preventive measure against severe mental health crises [45]."
166,Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Suicidal Thinking in Adolescents by Derivation and Validation in 3 Independent Worldwide Cohorts: Algorithm Development and Validation Study,"This emotional vulnerability is further compounded by physiological changes. The stress response, regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, is intensified during adolescence [38]. Heightened sensitivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis results in increased cortisol production in response to stress [39]. Chronic exposure to these elevated cortisol levels not only exacerbates feelings of sadness and despair but also directly contributes to an increased vulnerability to suicidal thoughts [40]. Understanding these relationships makes it evident that both the emotional responses induced by stress and the physiological effects of stress significantly influence the increased propensity for suicidal thinking during this critical phase of life."
167,Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Suicidal Thinking in Adolescents by Derivation and Validation in 3 Independent Worldwide Cohorts: Algorithm Development and Validation Study,"The influence of external portrayals, be it from peers or the media, cannot be underestimated. When adolescents confront additional adversities, such as bullying, social isolation, or academic failures, these inherent stressors are amplified. Adolescents exposed to narratives associating despair with suicidal behaviors might inadvertently absorb these sentiments. This phenomenon, known as ?suicide contagion,? postulates that exposure to others? suicidal actions can reshape an individual?s perspective [35]. The confluence of these environmental stressors and limited emotional regulation capacities heightens their vulnerability, potentially leading them to view suicide as a viable solution to their emotional turmoil [36]."
168,Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Suicidal Thinking in Adolescents by Derivation and Validation in 3 Independent Worldwide Cohorts: Algorithm Development and Validation Study,"Our research represents a pioneering machine-learning initiative for predicting suicidal thinking among adolescents. We sourced distinct data sets from South Korea (KYRBS), the United States (YRBS), and Norway (Ungdata). This provided comprehensive analysis related to socioeconomic indicators and key mental health influencers such as alcohol consumption, smoking status, and feelings of sadness and despair. Importantly, our findings highlight XGBoost as the optimal predictive model, achieving an AUROC of 88.6% with the KYRBS data set. External validation with the data from the United States and Norway yielded AUROCs of 82.9% and 83.6%, respectively. The most significant predictor of suicidal thinking was sadness and despair, with a feature influence of 61%, followed by stress status at 19.6%. Using SHAP values, we further emphasized the pivotal roles of sadness, despair, and stress in predicting suicidal thinking in adolescents. To enhance the practical application of our research, we have developed a web-based platform to visualize the prediction model, accompanied by a mobile interface, enhancing its accessibility and user experience. This dual-platform system provides a more methodical and analytical approach for the public to comprehend and manage potential suicidal concerns."
169,Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Suicidal Thinking in Adolescents by Derivation and Validation in 3 Independent Worldwide Cohorts: Algorithm Development and Validation Study,"We addressed a deeper visual interpretation of the SHAP values within our ML model (Figure S2 in�Multimedia Appendix 1) [29]. Figure S3 in�Multimedia Appendix 1�provides a waterfall plot, distinctively showcasing the cumulative contribution of each feature to a single prediction. We interpreted individual predictions by starting from the initial estimate and sequentially incorporating the influence of each feature to reach the final prediction. E[f(x)] refers to the average predicted output of the model across the entire data set, providing insights into the model?s overall prediction tendency. The starting point of the illustration, denoted as E[f(x)]=0.83, represents the model?s average prediction for the given data set. Among the variables, sadness and despair stood out, boosting the prediction by 1.17 and ranking as the most influential factor. Conversely, stress status and sex reduced the prediction by 0.86 and 0.22, respectively. This visualization offers a clear insight into the profound influence each feature wields in predicting adolescent suicidal thinking. Our ML model notably underscores a substantial reliance on the sadness, despair, and stress status features (Figure S3 in�Multimedia Appendix 1)."
170,Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Suicidal Thinking in Adolescents by Derivation and Validation in 3 Independent Worldwide Cohorts: Algorithm Development and Validation Study,"Table S1 in�Multimedia Appendix 1�and�Table 2�present the process of hyperparameter tuning the XGBoost model and the evaluation of our models conducted on data sets from 3 distinct countries using 5 performance metrics. Notably, XGBoost emerged as the frontrunner among the 4 tested models by getting hyperparameters of booster: gbtree, eval_metric: logloss, learning_rate: 0.08, max_depth: 5, n_estimators: 350, scale_pos_weight: 2, subsample: 0.09 (Table S1 in�Multimedia Appendix 1). When put to the training on the KYRBS data set from South Korea, with a 95% CI, the XGBoost model reported an AUROC of 90.06 (95% CI 89.97-90.16), sensitivity was 82.11 (95% CI 81.67-82.55), specificity was 82.16 (95% CI 81.68-82.63), accuracy was 82.13 (95% CI 82.01-82.26), and balanced accuracy was 82.13 (95% CI 82.01-82.26), consistently displaying superior results compared to the other 3 models. During the external validation assessment, the model evaluation was conducted without considering the 95% CI. For the external model validation, using the YRBS from the United States, the XGBoost model achieved an AUROC of 83.09%, sensitivity of 80.26%, specificity of 75.52%, accuracy of 76.58%, and balanced accuracy of 77.89%. For the external validation using the Ungdata from Norway, the XGBoost model achieved an AUROC of 81.27%, sensitivity of 79.19%, specificity of 80%, accuracy of 79.92%, and balanced accuracy of 79.60%. Across all data sets, XGBoost consistently outperformed all other models with the highest AUROC score, which was selected as the most optimal model (Figure 3)."
171,Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Suicidal Thinking in Adolescents by Derivation and Validation in 3 Independent Worldwide Cohorts: Algorithm Development and Validation Study,"The distribution of age in the initial training cohort for KYRBS from South Korea, which was used to build the prediction model, was as follows: aged 13 years (94,923/566,875, 16.74%), aged 14 years (98,624/566,875, 17.4%), aged 15 years (100,490/566,875, 17.73%), aged 16 years (90,057/566,875, 15.89%), aged 17 years (92,071/566,875, 16.24%), and aged 18 years (90,710/566,875, 16%). For the external validation cohort using YRBS from the United States, the age distribution was as follows: aged 13 years (351/103,874, 0.34%), aged 14 years (21,095/103,874, 20.31%), aged 15 years (28,016/103,874, 26.97%), aged 16 years (25,929/103,874, 24.96%), aged 17 years (22,405/103,874, 21.57%), and aged 18 years (6078/103,874, 5.85%). Another external validation stage using Ungdata from Norway had the following age distribution: aged 13 years (5039/19,574, 25.74%), aged 14 years (4874/19,574, 24.9%), aged 15 years (5034/19,574, 25.72%), aged 16 years (3181/19,574, 16.25%), aged 17 years (845/19,574, 4.32%), and aged 18 years (601/19,574, 3.07%) (Table 1)."

All participants provided written informed consent. This research followed the guidelines outlined in the TRIPOD (Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis) statement (Table S2 in�Multimedia Appendix 1)."
173,Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Suicidal Thinking in Adolescents by Derivation and Validation in 3 Independent Worldwide Cohorts: Algorithm Development and Validation Study,"We performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize the performance of the XGBoost model, prioritizing the maximization of the AUROC score to determine the optimal hyperparameter combination. Hyperparameters were carefully selected for improved performance: the gbtree booster was used for its effectiveness in classification tasks, and the logloss evaluation metric was chosen to ensure accurate probability estimations. We set the learning rate at 0.08 to balance training speed with model accuracy, and the max depth was capped at 5 to prevent overfitting while allowing the model to capture complex patterns. Additionally, 350 trees (n_estimators) were used to construct a robust model, with further adjustments made to parameters like ?scale_pos_weight? and subsample to address class imbalance and enhance model stability. These adjustments were important in refining our model?s predictive capabilities and are detailed in Table S1 in�Multimedia Appendix 1. In order to interpret and gain insights into the model predictions, we used Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) values, a unified measure derived from cooperative game theory. Data set variables were analyzed with SAS software (version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc), and ML analysis was performed using Python (version 3.11.4; Python Software Foundation). The main Python libraries used are as follows: NumPy (version 1.26.0; Python Software Foundation) for data arrays and operations, and Pandas (version 2.1.0; Python Software Foundation) for data manipulation and analysis. All 3?scikit-learn (version 1.2.2; scikit-learn development team), TensorFlow-gpu (version 2.6.0; Tensor development team), and Keras (version 2.6.0; Keras development team)?were used for constructing and training ML models [27]. Additionally, the SHAP package (version 0.42.1) was used to interpret the ML models and for its explanation capabilities [28]."
174,Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Suicidal Thinking in Adolescents by Derivation and Validation in 3 Independent Worldwide Cohorts: Algorithm Development and Validation Study,"We adopted the 10-fold cross-validation method, dividing the initial data set into 10 equal-sized subsets, to rigorously assess the performance efficacy of the ML model. Of these, 9 are designated for model training, while the remaining subset serves as validation [19]. The process iterates 10 times, ensuring each subset undergoes validation at least once. During each cycle, we computed various performance metrics such as area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and balanced accuracy, along with their respective 95% CIs [20-25]. The 95% CIs provide a range of possible values for the model?s performance metrics, allowing us to assess the stability and generalizability of the model. For a visual representation of the model efficacy, we used visualization methods, primarily the receiver operating characteristic curve. After 10 iterations, the metrics from each were averaged to determine the final performance evaluation."
175,Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Suicidal Thinking in Adolescents by Derivation and Validation in 3 Independent Worldwide Cohorts: Algorithm Development and Validation Study,"We harmonized the data sets for XGBoost model compatibility, addressing the challenge posed by different variable configurations within the same questions. Our preprocessing aligned each variable across the KYRBS, YRBS, and Ungdata data sets, ensuring they matched in terms of content and format. Recognizing the potential disparities in variable configurations across these data sets, we standardized the variable names, formats, and scales, focusing on key features such as demographic information, behavioral factors, psychosocial aspects, and environmental influences that could serve as predictors for suicidal thinking. To ensure consistency, we adopted the following strategic approach to cases where YRBS and Ungdata were missing certain features: by calculating the median of the missing variables in the KYRBS data set, we were able to effectively impute the missing values to maintain the integrity and comparability of the data set compilations. Through variable alignment and addressing missing data, we successfully harnessed the diverse strengths of each data set, facilitating the development of a comprehensive model designed to address adolescent suicidal thinking effectively."

Our approach used multiple variables extracted from 3 distinct, large-scale international data sources: the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey (KYRBS) [15,16], the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), and Norway?s nationwide University National General Survey (Ungdata)."
177,Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Suicidal Thinking in Adolescents by Derivation and Validation in 3 Independent Worldwide Cohorts: Algorithm Development and Validation Study,"While various methodologies have been proposed to prevent suicidal thinking in adolescents, many lack empirical outcomes and often fail to identify key determinants [7-9]. A significant gap remains in accurately assessing the risk of suicidal thinking for individual adolescents [2,10,11]. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) methodologies have shown promise in addressing the challenges of adolescent suicidal tendencies. Studies leveraging boosted ML [12], daily data analysis through classification and regression trees [13], and risk and protective factor frameworks [14] have begun to unpack the complex interplay of factors contributing to suicidal thinking among adolescents. However, these studies have also highlighted limitations, including a focus on specific socioeconomic or short-term predictors and a lack of comprehensive risk profiles integrating emotional, social, and psychological variables [12-14]."

181,"Machine learning-based model to predict delirium in patients with advanced cancer treated with palliative care: a multicenter, patient-based registry cohort","To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first creation of a machine learning model for predicting delirium in patients with advanced cancer admitted to the APCU. The use of this machine learning model for delirium prediction in APCU-admitted patients with advanced cancer can significantly improve patient quality of life and reduce physician workload. Especially for Korean healthcare providers with less educational experience in delirium53, the machine learning-based delirium prediction model of patients with advanced cancer could be part of a medical aid. Delirium episodes are particularly common in patients with advanced cancer in the APCU, with prevalence increasing as the terminal phase of the illness approaches. However, delirium in these patients has been inadequately identified and managed. Our model has the potential to profoundly impact risk assessment, early detection, and effective interventions for delirium in patients with advanced cancer."
182,"Machine learning-based model to predict delirium in patients with advanced cancer treated with palliative care: a multicenter, patient-based registry cohort","The primary strength of this study lies in the relatively high accuracy of the machine learning model for detecting delirium in patients with advanced cancer, as validated by testing datasets. Consistently high AUC values in both the training and testing datasets indicate that the combination model of XGBoost and RF is capable of predicting delirium in patients with advanced cancer. Important predictors of delirium include sex, history of delirium, chemotherapy during hospitalization, smoking status, alcohol consumption, living with family, and advanced age. The dataset was collected from four academic cancer centers, involving oncology-trained physicians and healthcare providers, providing a comprehensive view of risk factors associated with delirium in patients with advanced cancer and potentially aiding in the development of effective preventive interventions."

The combination model of XGBoost and RF demonstrated the best performance for predicting delirium in these patients, achieving a balanced accuracy of 69.84% and an AUROC of 74.55%. This performance was validated through both k-fold cross-validation and testing on an isolated dataset. Notably, sex emerged as the most critical feature for predicting delirium in patients with advanced cancer, followed by a history of delirium, chemotherapy during hospitalization, smoking status, alcohol consumption, living with family, and advanced age. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to use the machine learning model to predict delirium in South Korean patients with advanced cancer. These findings underscore the importance of delirium screening in APCU-admitted patients with advanced cancer and contribute to identifying the most significant risk factors for this patient group."

189,"Machine learning-based model to predict delirium in patients with advanced cancer treated with palliative care: a multicenter, patient-based registry cohort","We evaluated seven machine learning algorithms for predicting delirium in patients with advanced cancer: extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), gradient boosting (GBM), light gradient boosting (LGBM), logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF). For these seven machine learning algorithms, which were optimized by input parameters and hyperparameters, we applied an exhaustive search, which used to brute force through all possible combinations of a set of the hyperparameter combination yielding the best performance, with fivefold cross validation for each model to identify the most optimal hyperparameters. To estimate the uncertainty and variability of our results, we calculated the AUROC, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and balanced accuracy scores during the fivefold cross-validation process. These metrics were calculated by the following formulas with values of true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), false negative (FN) for binary classification:"

A well-trained physician and an academic nurse conducted this detailed review. Based on previous validation study, we did not use the code from the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases because it was deemed unreliable with low sensitivity22. Instead, we recorded all potential symptoms, signs, and associated medications and had at least two specialists (BDK and YJK) review each case. In case of any disagreement between the specialists, an additional specialist (SHY) was consulted to make the final decision."

192,"Machine learning-based model to predict delirium in patients with advanced cancer treated with palliative care: a multicenter, patient-based registry cohort","The machine learning model for predicting delirium in patients with advanced cancer has been explored, with suggested advantages9. However, this study only considered the decision-tree model, which is largely unstable because a small change in the data can result in a major change in the structure of the model. Therefore, a comprehensive study using machine learning models is needed to more accurately assess the features of delirium in patients with advanced cancer admitted to the APCU. We aimed to develop and compare a variety of machine learning models to predict delirium in patients with advanced cancer admitted to the APCU and investigate the significant features that influenced the machine learning model."
193,"Machine learning-based model to predict delirium in patients with advanced cancer treated with palliative care: a multicenter, patient-based registry cohort","Delirium, a common neuropsychiatric problem among patients with advanced cancer1, can result in extended hospital stays, higher mortality and morbidity rates, increased healthcare costs, and considerable distress for both patients and their family members, as well as healthcare providers2,3. Among patients with advanced cancer admitted to the acute palliative care unit (APCU), delirium can affect 42?88% of individuals4. However, few comprehensive studies have thoroughly examined its prevalence and potential risk factors5. Although effective preventive interventions for delirium in hospital settings are currently lacking, physicians and healthcare providers can alleviate modifiable risk factors within the APCU by providing exercise programs and family support to reduce the occurrence of delirium6. Therefore, early recognition and prevention are essential in patients with risk factors for developing delirium7."

196,Digital Mental Health Interventions for Adolescents in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Scoping Review,"To the authors? knowledge, 1 scoping review [123] has been published on DMHIs for adolescents in LMICs. Their review [123] was limited to mobile phones only; however, this review has a wider scope, which is more inclusive of the technological infrastructure in LMICs. Furthermore, this review has a more extensive search strategy, searching 10 databases and including gray literature such as dissertations and conference proceedings, and is a more robust evidence synthesis, whereas the review [123] only searched APA PsycINFO, Web of Science, Psychiatry Online, and EBSCOhost. Finally, the eligibility criteria are different, and the previous review is limited by its lack of specificity of publication parameters per publication dates. This review has been purposefully restricted to a 5-year period (2019-2024), as specified earlier in this paper."

Another study [82] reported similar findings in Colombia, noting that most adolescents impacted by COVID did not have access to support and treatment. This shortage of mental health professionals and a widening treatment gap, poor education, and community knowledge reinforced the stigma and false beliefs about mental health [82]."
198,Digital Mental Health Interventions for Adolescents in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Scoping Review,"Textbox 2�summarizes key barriers and facilitators from the included studies. Access and engagement with DMHIs can be impacted by financial, geographical, psychological, cultural, and structural factors [107-111]. Notable barriers were the affordability of devices, cultural appropriateness, power outages, poor digital and literacy skills, inadequate internet connectivity, and limited access to devices in rural areas. The findings are consistent with other LMICs [38,44,112]."
199,Digital Mental Health Interventions for Adolescents in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Scoping Review,"Incorporating evidence-based theories and techniques that encourage user engagement and behavior change is an essential element of DHI design [25,26,44,106]. Most DMHIs in this review were underpinned by cognitive-behavioral techniques involving behavioral activation and problem-solving features [71,72,76,78,84]. Some used stand-alone theories [23], for example, the social cognitive theory, and others used a combination of behavior change techniques [24], for example, theories of coping during adolescence, the self-determination theory, and the technology acceptance model. However, not all the papers explained how the behavior change theory or technique impacted the target user?s mental health. Or, indeed, the evidence on which the selection or combinations of theories were based [106]."
200,Digital Mental Health Interventions for Adolescents in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Scoping Review,"The advantages of involving adolescents in participatory and co-design approaches for DMHIs are well documented [67,98-104]. In this review, for example, adolescents were engaged in a series of co-design workshops for exploring existing popular apps, for example, Temple Run (Imangi Studios) and Candy Crush (King); story building, paper prototyping, and discussions about prototype ideas for POD Adventures [69]; the cocreation of an antistigma campaign as part of the main intervention for the ARTEMIS project [77]; and 1 study incorporated feedback from recent high school graduates into the design of the group-based Shamiri-Digital intervention as an iterative process of the intervention design [56]."
201,Digital Mental Health Interventions for Adolescents in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Scoping Review,"A critical design decision came from the inclusion of culturally validated elements. Some studies culturally adapted some components of the intervention [78,82]. Further, 1 study culturally validated an existing psychometric tool for their DMHI, for example, the study [24] adapted the Perceived Stress Scale to make it a reliable and valid instrument in keeping with the Thai culture. Additionally, another study [23] used the Farsi version of the Perceived Social Support Scale-Revised and the Farsi version of the Sherer General Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, reporting that the adapted scales were more appropriate and aligned to Iranian cultures. This aligns with existing literature emphasizing the importance of culturally appropriate DHIs [92,93]. Furthermore, they ensure resonance with the target populations? beliefs, practices, and values leading to improved engagement, treatment adherence, and outcomes [10,44,65,94-96]. In contrast, the Norwegian-designed Happy Helping Hand app was not adapted to the Arab culture for Syrian adolescents, and this was detrimental to the delivery of a DMHI, as themes were deemed religiously and culturally inappropriate, and therefore, certain aspects of the DMHI were skipped [71]."
202,Digital Mental Health Interventions for Adolescents in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Scoping Review,"The DMHIs were designed for depression, anxiety, self-harm, well-being, resilience, stigma, stress, and suicide ideation. However, this is not reflective of the broad and complex range of mental health disorders that adolescents develop, including substance misuse and posttraumatic stress disorder [1,6,45]. Concerning intervention settings, most were delivered in schools or hospitals. Indeed, previous studies have recognized schools as critical settings that offer a vital entry point for receiving adolescent mental health services [86,87]. Conversely, out-of-school adolescents or those unlikely to visit those hospitals may miss the opportunity to engage with the DMHIs [88]."
203,Digital Mental Health Interventions for Adolescents in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Scoping Review,"Overall, 14 different DMHIs were identified (POD Adventures is part of the PRIDE research program 2016-2022). DMHIs were designed for a limited range of mental health disorders, namely depression and anxiety. Almost all included adolescent input at the design stage, underscoring the importance of person-centered or user-centered approaches in DHIs. The DMHIs were delivered in diverse formats, including group delivery and self-guided methods, with lay staff or mental health professionals, including counselors, psychologists, or psychiatrists. Interventions were administered through smartphones, mobile phones, tablets, computers, and the web, often conducted in schools or clinical settings. Significant structural, psychological, and financial barriers exist in engagement with the DMHIs."
204,Digital Mental Health Interventions for Adolescents in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Scoping Review,"A total of 90% (18/20) reported on adolescent facilitators and barriers to DMHI engagement. Further, 3 (15%) studies were underway and, therefore, had no findings or results to report at the time of the present review. However, the authors listed factors that facilitated or impeded access to DMHIs for adolescents where possible (see�Textbox 2)."
205,Digital Mental Health Interventions for Adolescents in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Scoping Review,"Of the 20 papers, 60% (12/20) involved adolescents in co-designing [85] or participatory approaches at the design stage. For instance, the content of DepisNet-Thai [24] was developed from discussions with adolescents. Elsewhere, co-designing activities informed the development of POD Adventures [69], PRIDE [74], antistigma materials for ARTEMIS (Adolescents? Resilience and Treatment Needs for Mental Health in Indian Slums) [73], and the Kuamsha app [70]. Adolescents contributed to intervention designs via group discussions for Smartteen [84] and Shamiri-Digital [21]. Some interventions were existing DMHIs adapted to the target users? cultural contexts, for example, the Happy Helping Hand was initially launched in Norway but was developed in collaboration with adolescent Syrian refugees and Norwegian adolescents. It was later culturally adapted for use with refugee adolescents in Lebanon [71,72]. Furthermore, the Happy Helping Hand materials were also adapted for Ukrainian adolescents [78]. In an ongoing study (1/20, 5%), an Adolescent Expert Advisory Group will guide researchers on all aspects of the project design, development, and implementation [77]."
206,Digital Mental Health Interventions for Adolescents in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Scoping Review,"A total of 14 different DMHIs were identified, addressing one or more of the following mental health disorders: depression, 65% (13/20); well-being, 30% (6/20); emotional problem-solving, 20% (4/20); anxiety, 30% (6/20); distress, 5% (1/20); suicidal ideation, 10% (2/20); stigma, 10% (2/20); resilience, 5% (1/20); self-harm, 15% (3/20); and general mental health disorders, 10% (2/20). The main combination was depression and anxiety.

226,Digital Mental Health Interventions for Adolescents in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Scoping Review,The subreview questions (subRQs) were as follows:
227,Digital Mental Health Interventions for Adolescents in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Scoping Review,"There are issues with DMHI implementation, posing a barrier to scalability. Many DMHIs, for example, require additional guidance for adolescent adherence and engagement, such as psychologists, therapists, or lay teacher support [43,44]. This may undermine the scalability of the interventions due to the shortage of health professionals for those roles [44]. Other challenges relate to their feasibility [45], political nature [46], cultural appropriateness [47], design, deployment, evaluation [48], sustainability [49], cost-effectiveness [50], privacy and data security [51], digital maturity, and readiness [52-54]. Despite this, there is evidence that DMHIs could transform adolescent mental health in low-resource settings [50,55-57]."
228,Digital Mental Health Interventions for Adolescents in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Scoping Review,"Presently, there are significant and systemic barriers that limit adolescent access to mental health services, for example, cost, time, geographic location [27], stigma [28,29], lack of community knowledge and education on mental health [30], and low mental health literacy [31]. Mental health systems in LMICs lack trained mental health specialists, leading to significantly understaffed services [30,32,33]. These shortages are unequal, with urban areas benefiting from more health specialists and resources than rural areas [34,35]. Consequently, this is a potential barrier to treatment because the physical distance may place many services out of reach, thereby reinforcing the rural-urban digital divide [36]. The term digital divide can be understood as ?the gap between people who do and do not have access to forms of information and communication technology? [37]. The concept is complex, going beyond the connected versus the unconnected. It is a global phenomenon but even more pronounced in LMIC settings, leading to further social, cultural, and economic inequalities [38,39]."
229,Digital Mental Health Interventions for Adolescents in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Scoping Review,"The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened the significant burden on this population [8,11,12]. Before the pandemic, researchers explored the feasibility and clinical benefits of digital health technologies for adolescent mental health and care in LMICs [13-15]. Indeed, COVID-19 has driven the adoption of digital health care platforms in LMICs, including digital interventions for health [8,16]. Digital health interventions (DHIs) are increasingly accepted tools for the support of adolescent mental health [17-19]."
230,Digital Mental Health Interventions for Adolescents in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Scoping Review,"In 2020, the WHO?UNICEF (United Nations International Children?s Emergency Fund)?Lancet Commission called for a renewed focus on the SDGs for advancing child and adolescent health, including mental health [5]. The Commission made a powerful argument that children and adolescents should be at the center of the SDGs to protect their human rights. In addition, this was an ethical and economic investment [5]. Despite this, the�World Mental Health Report�states that approximately 90 WHO member states?less than half of all member states?had a mental health policy or plan specifically for children and adolescents [1]. The report emphasizes the importance of national mental health plans that are fully compliant with human rights instruments, sufficiently resourced, and regularly monitored and evaluated [1]."
231,Digital Mental Health Interventions for Adolescents in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Scoping Review,"While there have been notable advancements in DMHIs for adolescents in LMICs, the research base remains limited. Significant knowledge gaps persist regarding the long-term clinical benefits, the maturity and readiness of LMIC digital infrastructure, cultural appropriateness, and cost-effectiveness across the heterogeneous LMIC settings. Addressing these gaps necessitates large-scale, co-designed, and culturally sensitive DMHI trials. Future work should address this."
232,Digital Mental Health Interventions for Adolescents in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Scoping Review,"The Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review methodology was used, following the recommendations of the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews). Our search strategy incorporated 3 key concepts: population ""adolescents,"" concept ""digital mental health interventions,"" and context ""LMICs."" We adapted this strategy for various databases, including ACM Digital Library, APA PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar (including gray literature), IEEE Xplore, ProQuest, PubMed (NLM), ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Web of Science.

233,Digital Mental Health Interventions for Adolescents in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Scoping Review,"Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) are increasingly recognized as potential solutions for adolescent mental health, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The United Nations? Sustainable Development Goals and universal health coverage are instrumental tools for achieving mental health for all. Within this context, understanding the design, evaluation, as well as the barriers and facilitators impacting adolescent engagement with mental health care through DMHIs is essential."
234,Neurostructural subgroup in 4291 individuals with schizophrenia identified using the subtype and stage inference algorithm,"Regional morphological measures for each individual with schizophrenia were adjusted by regressing out the effects of sex, age, the square of age, TIV and site, and then transformed to z-scores (i.e., normative deviations from healthy control group). The mean regional morphological z-score across individuals belonging to each subtype was calculated, and mapped to brain templates for visualization of neuroanatomical signature deviation for each subtype relative to healthy population. To further manifest subtype-specific signature in neuroanatomical pathology, we compared the regional morphological z-scores between the two subtypes using two sample�t-tests. Multiple comparisons were corrected by family wise error (FWE) correction."
235,Neurostructural subgroup in 4291 individuals with schizophrenia identified using the subtype and stage inference algorithm,"To examine whether the SuStaIn stage (a continuous indicator of the ?temporal? stage of SuStaIn ?trajectory?) is associated with pathological processes and clinical characteristics in schizophrenia, we performed Spearman correlations between the SuStaIn stages and the degree of brain atrophy (i.e., regional GMV) in schizophrenia. We also examined whether SuStaIn stages were linked to disease duration, severity of symptoms, and phenotypic characteristics."
236,Neurostructural subgroup in 4291 individuals with schizophrenia identified using the subtype and stage inference algorithm,"First, we used the Hopkins statistics to establish whether the data is clustered. A high value (H?=?0.7756) shows a high clustering tendency at 90% confidence level, supporting a robust existence of clusters. SuStaIn can identify diverse trajectories of pathophysiological progression given a subtype number�K. We fitted the model for�K?=?2-6 subtypes (?trajectories?), separately. The optimal number of subtypes was determined according to the reproducibility of individual subtyping via a two-fold cross-validation procedure22. Specifically, all individuals were randomly split into two non-overlapping folds. This above procedure was repeated ten times. For each fold, we trained the SuStaIn model. For each individual, the trained SuStaIn model provides a subtype label. We measured the consistency of the subtype labeling across all individuals between two folds by using the Dice coefficient. The largest Dice coefficient was obtained for�K?=?2 (see Fig.�1a), indicating the best consistency based on cross-validation. Finally, the two-cluster model of SuStaIn was fitted to the entire sample. The most probable sequence (i.e., the order of biomarkers) was evaluated for each ?trajectory? via SuStaIn. For each individual, SuStaIn calculated the probability (ranging from 0 to 1) of belonging to each ?trajectory?, and assigned the individual into a sub-stage of the maximum likelihood ?trajectory? through MCMC iterations. We also estimated the SuStaIn ?trajectories? based on a subsample from individuals with first-episode schizophrenia whose illness duration was less than two years (N?=?1122, 513 females, mean age=25.4?�?8.6 years), and a subsample of medication-na�ve individuals with schizophrenia (N?=?718, 353 females, mean age=23.7?�?7.8 years)."
237,Neurostructural subgroup in 4291 individuals with schizophrenia identified using the subtype and stage inference algorithm,"The ROI-wise GMV measures were first adjusted by regressing out the effects of sex, age, the square of age, site and total intracranial volume (TIV) using a regression model22. Subsequently, a harmonization procedure was performed using the ComBat algorithm for correcting multi-site data70. The adjusted values were transformed as z-scores (i.e., normative deviations) relative to the healthy control group. We multiplied these z-scores by -1 so that the z-score increases as regional GMV decreases. Finally, we removed these samples if they were marked as a statistical outlier (if any of their regional volumes >5 standard deviations away from the group-level average). After the quality control, 11,260 individuals were included, of which 4222 were schizophrenia patients (1683 females, mean age=32.4?�?12.4 years) and 7038 healthy subjects (3440 females, mean age=33.0?�?12.4 years)."

The present study was carried out under the approve from the Medical Research Ethics Committees of Fudan University (Number:�FE222711)."
239,Neurostructural subgroup in 4291 individuals with schizophrenia identified using the subtype and stage inference algorithm,"This study analyzed cross-sectional T1-weighted structural MRI data from a total of 4,291 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia (1,709 females, mean age=32.5?�?11.9 years) and 7,078 healthy controls (3,461 females, mean age=33.0?�?12.7 years). These datasets came from 21 cohorts of ENIGMA schizophrenia working groups from various countries around the world, 11 cohorts collected from Chinese hospitals over the last ~10 years, and 9 cohorts from publicly available datasets, i.e., HCP-EP58, JP-SRPBS59, fBIRN60, MCIC61, NMorphCH62, NUSDAST63,�DS00003064,�DS00011565�and�DS00430266. The datasets came from various countries around the world. Details of demographics, geographic location, clinical characteristics, and inclusion/exclusion criteria for each cohort may be found in the Supplementary Information (Supplementary Table�1?2)."
240,Neurostructural subgroup in 4291 individuals with schizophrenia identified using the subtype and stage inference algorithm,"This study has several limitations. First, while the SuStaIn algorithm estimates pathophysiological trajectories from cross-sectional MRI data, it remains crucial to validate these outcomes with longitudinal data to verify the brain changes with disease progression over time. Second, the current study benefits from a large sample size, but the inclusion of data from various sites could potentially be influenced by confounding factors, including diverse cohorts, scanners, and locations. Harmonization methods have been employed to alleviate disparities across MRI acquisition protocols. Nonetheless, it remains essential to collect a sufficiently large sample from multi-centers under a standard imaging protocol and experimental paradigm. The lack of cognitive evaluation limits to examine the association of neurostructural biotype with cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. Third, a substantial portion of individuals with schizophrenia were likely to have received or currently use medications, and data from medication-na�ve/free individuals were only available for a subset of the datasets. One important limitation is the assumption of progressive pathology in schizophrenia (discrete events of tissue loss or continuous downward drift), when applying SuStaIn. The few existing very long-term imaging studies in schizophrenia support this stance57�but selection bias cannot be fully overcome in the recruitment process for neuroimaging studies. Routine anatomical MRI for every person with psychosis seeking help, with periodic repeats, may provide better view of the validity of progressive pathology in the future. The selection of z-score waypoints and maximum z-score used in the SuStaIn algorithm should be careful based on prior information about degree of progress in different diseases. The computational complexity of the SuStaIn algorithm is highly time-consuming, which limits the exploration of spatiotemporal patterns of trajectories at finer spatial resolutions."
241,Neurostructural subgroup in 4291 individuals with schizophrenia identified using the subtype and stage inference algorithm,"The subtyping method exhibits high potential for distinguishing neurostructural subtypes with shared pathophysiological foundations. Notably, subtype 1 displayed larger volume of the striatum, while subtype 2 demonstrated reduced volume. This was consistent with a previous study, which also identified two anatomical subtypes of schizophrenia: one shows enlarged volume in the basal ganglia; whereas the other shows widespread volumetric reduction in the cortical and some subcortical areas relative to healthy controls15. The striatum plays a key role in the dopamine system, which contributes to psychotic symptoms47. Nevertheless, studies of striatal pathology have reported inconsistent differences between patients and controls3. The variability of the striatum is greater in patients than in controls, which relates to overall structural morphometry28, dopamine D2 receptor and transporter levels48. This indicates that differences might exist within subgroups of the disorder3. Alterations in striatal activation are associated with reward-related deficits in schizophrenia49. A previous study suggests that disrupted putamen-cortices connectivity during reward-related processing is directly linked to structural changes in the putamen50. Despite the unclear causal relationship, this suggests that the differential effects on striatal volume between the two subtypes may be related to striatal dysfunction in schizophrenia. In addition, it is still uncertain whether the discrepancy in striatum between cases and controls indicates a primary pathology or an effect of antipsychotic treatment3. Interestingly, this study?s subtype-specific striatal differences were replicated in a subset of individuals who had not received antipsychotic treatment, suggesting that striatal variability persists even in those without antipsychotic treatment. In addition, a recent study reveals a more pronounced and widespread pattern of thinner cortex in deficit schizophrenia, a clinically defined subtype with primary, enduring negative symptoms, compared to non-deficit schizophrenia51. A recent work also reveals that the neuro-structural signature with cortical reduction was associated with progressive illness course, worse cognitive performance and elevated schizophrenia polygenic risk scores52. This also suggests the existence of distinct subtypes distinguished by unique neuroimaging features. Taken together, our neurostructural subtyping differentiated subgroups with unique pathological features, thereby enhancing our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying schizophrenia."
242,Neurostructural subgroup in 4291 individuals with schizophrenia identified using the subtype and stage inference algorithm,"Despite the growing body of evidence pointing to group-level gray matter volume deficits in various brain regions - especially in frontal and temporal regions - as well as altered subcortical volume in schizophrenia28, substantial individual variations persist within this population8,29. These inter-individual differences in brain structure may stem from two primary sources of variation. First, differences in underlying etiology and pathogenesis could result in varying clinical characteristics (referred to as phenotypic heterogeneity)3,30. Second, relative differences among subjects in the stage of dynamic progression (known as temporal heterogeneity) could further increase differences in the clinical presentation31,32. Such variations suggest that the pathological progression of schizophrenia might not be attributed to a single unified pathophysiological process. Indeed, our neurostructural subtypes uncovered two SuStaIn trajectories of gray matter loss through brain structural imaging. Several studies also reported dynamic patterns of accelerated gray matter loss over time in individuals with schizophrenia33,34. In addition, the staging of SuStaIn trajectory within the subtype reflects the underlying neurophysiological, pathological, and neuropsychological progressions in schizophrenia. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the phenotypic difference in the intrinsic neuro-pathophysiological trajectory was reproducible across samples worldwide, independent of macroeconomic and ethnic factors that differed across these sites."
243,Neurostructural subgroup in 4291 individuals with schizophrenia identified using the subtype and stage inference algorithm,"We investigated whether the SuStaIn subtyping and staging can be generalized to unseen cohorts. A flowchart is shown in Supplementary Fig.�6a. Specifically, the Asian and Europe SuStaIn models were separately built based on the Asian ancestry cohorts and Europe ancestry cohorts, as described in 2.3. The two models were used for subtyping and staging those unseen samples. We compared whether those subtype and stage assignments match the result of the original model that has been built on all cohorts. We observed that most of the unseen individuals can keep the same subtype label with the original model (88.83% for the Asian model; 89.98% for the European model) (Supplementary Fig.�6b). In addition, there was a high consistency of individual staging between stages of unseen data and original model result (Asian model,�r?=?0.976,�p?<?0.001; Europe model,�r?=?0.979,�p?<?0.001, Spearman correlation test) (Supplementary Fig.�6c). These results indicates a high generalized ability of SuStaIn model to unseen data."
244,Neurostructural subgroup in 4291 individuals with schizophrenia identified using the subtype and stage inference algorithm,"Regional morphological z-scores (i.e., normative deviations from healthy control group) for each subtype were computed and compared (Fig.�3). Morphological z-scores of all brain regions and inter-subtype comparisons are provided in Supplementary Table�5. Briefly, compared to healthy controls, average cortical volume/area reduction was only observed in subtype 1 (Supplementary Fig.�3a?b), though both subtype 1 and subtype 2 exhibited a moderate reduction in average cortical thickness (Supplementary Fig.�3c). Additionally, largest effects for cortical thickness/volume/area were located within the superior frontal regions for subtype 1 and in the superior/medial temporal regions for subtype2 (Supplementary Table�5). As for subcortical volume, larger effects for volumes of hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, accumbens and brain stem were observed in subtype 2 compared to subtype 1 (Supplementary Fig.�3d?h). The hippocampal/amygdala subregions with the most significant reduction for subtype 2 were located in the molecular layer and cortico-amygdaloid transition area (Supplementary Fig.�4?5). Interestingly, we observed that, compared to healthy controls, the striatum (i.e., caudate, putamen) was larger among subtype 1 patients and smaller among subtype 2 patients (Supplementary Fig.�3i?j). The difference in the striatum between the two subtypes was also replicated in a subsample of medication-naive individuals with schizophrenia (Supplementary Table�6). The main findings of subtype-specific neuroanatomical signatures are described in Table�2. Taken together, subtype 1 exhibited greater deficits in cortical morphology but enlarged volume of the striatum, whereas subtype 2 displayed more severe volume loss in the subcortical regions, including the hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, brain stem and striatum."
245,Neurostructural subgroup in 4291 individuals with schizophrenia identified using the subtype and stage inference algorithm,"The SuStaIn calculated the probability of each patient belonging to a specific ?trajectory? and further assigned them to a sub-stage within that ?trajectory?. Individuals who were assigned to the later stages of the ?trajectory? showed a significant correlation with less GMV of Broca?s area (Fig.�1e,�r?=?0.651,�p?<?0.0001) and hippocampus (Fig.�1f,�r?=?0.615,�p?<?0.0001). In addition, the later stages were correlated with longer disease duration (Fig.�1g,�r?=?0.105,�p?<?0.0001), worse negative symptoms (Fig.1h,�r?=?0.101,�p?<?0.0001) and worse cognitive symptoms (Fig.1i,�r?=?0.080,�p?=?0.004). These results suggest that the SuStaIn ?trajectory? reflects the underlying neural progression in schizophrenia."
246,Neurostructural subgroup in 4291 individuals with schizophrenia identified using the subtype and stage inference algorithm,"The sample size of this study was large enough to allow further exploratory analyses to identify pathophysiological progression trajectories in more homogeneous subsamples of schizophrenia. Here, we re-estimated the SuStaIn ?trajectories? based on a subsample of data from individuals with first-episode schizophrenia with illness duration less than two years (N?=?1122; 513 females, mean age=25.4?�?8.6 years), and a subsample of medication-na�ve individuals with schizophrenia (N?=?718, 353 females, mean age?=?23.7?�?7.8 years) (Supplementary Table�3). In both subsamples, we replicated the two ?trajectories? with either the Broca?s area or the hippocampus as the sites of origin (Supplementary Fig.�2), indicating that the two initiating regions - ranking ahead of other regional deficits?are the pathological effects of the disease itself, rather than medication-induced effects. Broca?s area and the hippocampus may, therefore, be candidate targets for intervention in schizophrenia, as these two brain regions were affected early in the disease process."
247,Neurostructural subgroup in 4291 individuals with schizophrenia identified using the subtype and stage inference algorithm,"Distinct patterns of spatiotemporal progression of pathophysiological progression were identified using SuStaIn, based on cross-sectional MRI data from 4222 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia (1683 females, mean age=32.4?�?11.9 years) and 7038 healthy subjects (3440 females, mean age=33.0?�?12.6 years) (Table�1). A 2-fold cross-validation procedure resulted in an optimal number of�K?=?2 clusters (subtypes) as determined by the largest Dice coefficient (Fig.�1a), indicating the best consistency of the subtype labeling across all individuals for a model in two independent schizophrenia populations. Figure�1b�shows that only 1.2% of people were moved from subtype 1 to subtype 2, and 7.5% were moved from subtype 2 to subtype 1, indicating that 91.3% of individuals? subtype labels were consistent between the SuStaIn classifications from two non-overlapping data folds. These findings suggest the presence of two stable schizophrenia biotypes with distinct ?trajectories? of pathophysiological progression (here, we put SuStaIn trajectory in quotes as it is not an actual longitudinal trajectory but rather a typical sequence of disease progression reconstructed from cross-sectional data)."
248,Neurostructural subgroup in 4291 individuals with schizophrenia identified using the subtype and stage inference algorithm,"The Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA,�http://enigma.ini.usc.edu) consortium is dedicated to conducting large-scale analyzes by pooling brain imaging data from research teams worldwide, using standardized image processing protocols. Previously, ENIGMA published findings revealing thinner cerebral cortex, smaller surface area, and altered subcortical volumes in schizophrenia compared to controls24,25. Here, we included structural MRI data obtained from 4291 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia and 7078 healthy controls from 41 international cohorts from ENIGMA schizophrenia groups worldwide and other non-ENIGMA datasets (Supplementary Table�1?2). The large sample size allowed us to conduct systematic and comprehensive analyzes to verify the reproducibility and generality of neurostructural subtypes of schizophrenia across regions/locations and disease stages. This study?s aims were: (1) to validate the two neurostructural subtypes with distinct trajectories of neuro-pathophysiological progression in schizophrenia, (2) to verify the reproducibility and generality of the neurostructural subtypes, in subsamples across the world and across disease stages, and (3) to characterize subtype-specific signatures in terms of neuroanatomy and clinical symptomatic trajectory."
249,Neurostructural subgroup in 4291 individuals with schizophrenia identified using the subtype and stage inference algorithm,"Schizophrenia is one of the most severely disabling psychiatric disorders with a life-time prevalence of 1%; it affects approximately 26 million people worldwide1. The etiology of schizophrenia is still not fully understood. Current knowledge implicates multiple neurobiological mechanisms and pathophysiologic processes2,3. Furthermore, people diagnosed with schizophrenia show a substantial heterogeneity in clinical symptoms4, disease progression5, treatment response6, and other biological markers7,8. In addition, currently available treatments are not aligned with specific pathophysiological pathways/targets, which limits effectiveness of treatment selection9. Establishing a new taxonomy by identifying distinct subtypes based on neurobiological data could help resolve some of these heterogeneity-induced challenges. A key goal is to define biological subtypes, based on objective measures derived from imaging and other biomarkers10."
250,Neurostructural subgroup in 4291 individuals with schizophrenia identified using the subtype and stage inference algorithm,"Machine learning can be used to define subtypes of psychiatric conditions based on shared biological foundations of mental disorders. Here we analyzed cross-sectional brain images from 4,222 individuals with schizophrenia and 7038 healthy subjects pooled across 41 international cohorts from the ENIGMA, non-ENIGMA cohorts and public datasets. Using the Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) algorithm, we identify two distinct neurostructural subgroups by mapping the spatial and temporal ?trajectory? of gray matter change in schizophrenia. Subgroup 1 was characterized by an early cortical-predominant loss with enlarged striatum, whereas subgroup 2 displayed an early subcortical-predominant loss in the hippocampus, striatum and other subcortical regions. We confirmed the reproducibility of the two neurostructural subtypes across various sample sites, including Europe, North America and East Asia. This imaging-based taxonomy holds the potential to identify individuals with shared neurobiological attributes, thereby suggesting the viability of redefining existing disorder constructs based on biological factors."

253,Natural Language Processing and Social Determinants of Health in Mental Health Research: AI-Assisted Scoping Review,"Future work could be facilitated by this review, which revealed a considerable number of shared research datasets, including URLs for some. In fact, over 600 publications disclosed the datasets they used and the level of access as public or semipublic. Disclosure of dataset use is important in research because it increases reproducibility and facilitates collaborative secondary research using existing data. A recent publication has reported that over half of the studies in psychology could not be replicated [53], which is why it is crucial to be transparent about the datasets used and the NLP methods used. Moreover, making both the code and data available to the scientific community whenever possible or providing information on why access to data is restricted is also valuable. A dataset prepared for a specific study can be used in secondary research different from the original work and may help prevent redundant data collection. A 2024 crowdsourcing challenge on HeroX was specifically aimed to ?demonstrate the power of data reuse in advancing human health by proposing an impactful secondary data analysis research project? and promoted the reuse of data that has already been published."
254,Natural Language Processing and Social Determinants of Health in Mental Health Research: AI-Assisted Scoping Review,"The paucity of mental health NLP studies that consider SDOH is concerning, especially considering that these factors, including stress, marital status, race, gender-based discrimination, and many others, have been shown to impact mental health outcomes [38]. One of the challenges for mental health researchers is a lack of versatile NLP tools that would allow the extraction of attributes related to SDOH and demographics. For example, while NLP models for extraction of marital status and gender exist [39,40], few models can extract a big range of SDOH at once [41], making a subgroup analysis limited to select demographic attributes (eg, age and gender). Another solution could be to extract this information from structured data. However, this is often not feasible; for example, social media metadata rarely contain information about age, region, and other sociodemographic attributes, while EHRs that contain clinical notes do not routinely collect social information [41]."
255,Natural Language Processing and Social Determinants of Health in Mental Health Research: AI-Assisted Scoping Review,"A narrative review by Shokouh et al [36] explores the idea that demographic variables could be considered an essential part of SDOH.

A recent statement by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence highlights the potential of AI in the systematic review process automation [17]."
284,Natural Language Processing and Social Determinants of Health in Mental Health Research: AI-Assisted Scoping Review,"Another potential problem with research using NLP for mental health is insufficient consideration of social determinants of health (SDOH) information during the analysis. The association between social determinants and mental health outcomes is well-established, with factors such as poverty, inequality, stigma, discrimination, and social exclusion identified as significant contributors to mental health burdens [10,11]. NLP has become a valuable tool for extracting SDOH from sources like clinical notes, social media, and EHR in health care research [12-15]. Evaluating the use of SDOH in NLP projects for mental health is another goal behind this review."

Furthermore, NLP has been used to increase prediction accuracy and reduce subgroup differences in personnel selection decisions, showcasing its value in improving decision-making processes [9]."
286,Natural Language Processing and Social Determinants of Health in Mental Health Research: AI-Assisted Scoping Review,"Natural language processing (NLP) has emerged as a valuable tool in mental health research, offering innovative ways to extract and analyze information from various sources. Studies have shown the feasibility of using NLP in extracting evidence of online gaming and internet use from electronic health records (EHRs) in adolescent mental health patients [1]. NLP applied to clinical notes has been found to more accurately identify mental illness and substance use among people living with HIV compared to structured EHR fields alone [2]. Furthermore, NLP in healthcare enables the transformation of complex narrative information into valuable products like clinical decision support and adverse event monitoring in real-time via EHRs [3,4]."

The United States contributed the highest number of studies (n=568, 36.6%), with depression (n=438, 28.2%) and suicide (n=240, 15.5%) being the most frequently investigated mental health issues. Traditional demographic variables, such as age (n=877, 56.5%) and gender (n=760, 49%), were commonly extracted, while SDOH factors were less frequently reported, with urban or rural status being the most used (n=19, 1.2%).

289,Prediction of postpartum depression in women: development and validation of multiple machine learning models,"In this study, by combining biopsychosocial risk factors for PPD, we developed and validated ML predictive models to identify the risk of PPD. The LR and ANN models showed excellent and reliable prediction performance. Combining prenatal and postnatal predictors to establish predictive models can significantly improve prediction performance. Various risk assessment tools are easily implemented in practice and could help physicians make clinical decisions easily. Therefore, we believe that our study could be utilized to individually predict the risk of PPD in prenatal and postnatal women, thus assisting clinicians in early precise intervention and effectively reducing or delaying the development of PPD. However, external validation is required to demonstrate the accuracy of the model?s predictions in future studies."
290,Prediction of postpartum depression in women: development and validation of multiple machine learning models,"From a clinical perspective, this study has significant implications for improving PPD screening and intervention strategies. Traditional screening methods for PPD are often time-consuming and require trained personnel, limiting their scalability in resource-constrained settings. The ML-based models developed in this study provide a rapid and automated risk assessment framework, allowing early identification of high-risk individuals. Moreover, by integrating both prenatal and postpartum predictors, these models offer a dynamic approach to monitoring maternal mental health from pregnancy to postpartum recovery. The practical implementation of our risk assessment tools in clinical settings can facilitate targeted interventions, optimize resource allocation, and improve maternal and neonatal outcomes. We suggest that these tools could be embedded in hospital electronic health record systems and routine perinatal care in the future. Clinicians can utilize these assessment tools in real-time during prenatal and postpartum visits for prenatal PPD risk stratification and postpartum PPD monitoring. During routine prenatal screenings, clinicians can input readily available variables into the web-based calculator to generate individualized PPD risk scores. This enables early identification of high-risk women, prompting targeted mental health interventions such as counseling or prophylactic therapy. Moreover, pregnant women outside the hospital can use the web calculator to self-assess their PPD risk. The dynamic integration of postnatal predictors allows for ongoing risk reassessment during postpartum checkups, ensuring timely adjustments to care plans. However, several potential barriers to their implementation must be acknowledged. First, embedding these tools into electronic health records requires interoperability with existing hospital systems, which may involve technical and administrative hurdles. Second, healthcare providers may need training to effectively interpret ML-derived risk scores and SHAP-based explanations. Notably, the ethical implications of false positives and negatives in PPD prediction warrant careful deliberation. Overestimation of risk could lead to unnecessary psychological interventions, increasing perinatal women?s anxiety and healthcare costs, and underestimation of risk may delay critical interventions. While SHAP values enhance interpretability, clinicians must remain vigilant against over-reliance on model outputs. Therefore, we recommend combining model predictions with clinical judgment and longitudinal symptom monitoring to ensure perinatal women?s safety and well-being. Additionally, clinicians should be aware of the potential psychological impact on patients when these assessment tools are used for risk prediction, and appropriate counseling should be provided when necessary."
291,Prediction of postpartum depression in women: development and validation of multiple machine learning models,"Discrimination, calibration, and clinical net benefit were best in the LR and ANN models (for both PN-PPD and PP-PPD models). Collectively, the newly developed LR and ANN models, which incorporated readily available prenatal and postnatal variables, performed well, as supported by the AUC values of 0.787?0.858 in the validation set. In addition to AUC, we utilize other evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, and F1 score, to evaluate the performance of LR and ANN models. With its relatively simpler structure, the LR model displayed excellent interpretability and high performance across these key metrics. While the ANN model demonstrated a similar AUC and F1 score, it has the advantage of powerful self-learning capabilities, which make it particularly well-suited for capturing complex nonlinear relationships in the data. The higher F1 scores of LR and ANN models indicate that both models strike a reasonable balance between precision and recall, thus ensuring that false positives and negatives are minimized, which is critical in clinical decision-making. For the term of calibration, the agreements between prediction and actuality are shown in the calibration plots. More importantly, the decision curve analysis showed that the LR and ANN models could provide good clinical net benefits to support clinical decision-making. Regarding model applicability, the LR model has the characteristics of a simple structure and strong interpretability. Compared with the LR model, the ANN model has powerful self-learning capabilities and an outstanding advantage in dealing with nonlinear relationships. However, the difference in prediction performance between the two models was insignificant in the study. Furthermore, adding postnatal predictors to the prenatal models can improve prediction performance. Therefore, we recommend combining prenatal and postnatal predictors to enhance the predictive accuracy of PPD. In future research, better prediction results may be achieved with more prenatal and postpartum clinical information."
292,Prediction of postpartum depression in women: development and validation of multiple machine learning models,"This is the first study to present a novel approach to determine the risk factors for predicting PPD by integrating seven feature selection techniques with real-world perinatal data. Unlike previous models that relied on a limited set of predictors, our study incorporates these methods to systematically identify the most relevant risk factors, ensuring a robust and generalizable model. Additionally, by comparing six ML algorithms, we comprehensively evaluate different modeling strategies, demonstrating that LR and ANN algorithms achieve superior predictive performance. A key innovation is the development of interactive risk assessment tools, including nomograms and web-based risk calculators, which facilitate immediate clinical application. Notably, by employing SHAP values to enhance interpretability, our study bridges the gap between complex ML models and practical clinical decision-making, allowing healthcare providers to understand and trust the model?s predictions."
293,Prediction of postpartum depression in women: development and validation of multiple machine learning models,"We generated three types of nomograms to provide convenient and personalized risk estimates of PPD. The static and interactive nomograms were assigned in proportion to the effect sizes in the LR model (Supplementary Figs. S15?18). The dynamic nomogram was developed to allow clinicians to enter the values of the variables and then obtain the risk of PPD (https://yongjianwang.shinyapps.io/PN_PPD_Nomogram/�and�https://yongjianwang.shinyapps.io/PP_PPD_Nomogram/) (Supplementary Figs. S19 and 20). Moreover, to further improve the clinical application of the models, we calculated the risk-stratification score separately for prenatal and postnatal screening based on the LR coefficients (Supplementary Tables S11 and 12). Tertiles of the total risk scores (16 to 23 for the PN-PPD model and 6 to 19 for the PP-PPD model) were used to categorize low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups for perinatal women."

The actual data were collected prospectively at four-time points and could be classified into four categories:"
305,Prediction of postpartum depression in women: development and validation of multiple machine learning models,"Inspired by these advances and limitations, the purpose of the present study was to (1) identify the predictors of PPD, (2) develop multiple risk prediction models for perinatal women, and (3) design various clinical assessment tools for early screening and personalized care."
306,Prediction of postpartum depression in women: development and validation of multiple machine learning models,"PPD not only has severe and lasting adverse effects on mothers, infants, and partners [40,�42] but also affects harmonious family relationships, increases medical expenditures, and impedes social development [34,�44]. Although the exact etiology of PPD is unknown, early identification and appropriate intervention by combining biopsychosocial factors to predict the risk of PPD can help prevent the abovementioned adverse effects. Consistently, self-report questionnaires [such as the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)] are the primary tools for PPD screening, and diagnosis is mainly dependent on the presence of clinical symptoms [19]. In this case, PPD may have already occurred but may not have been noted before the screening. In addition, some perinatal women with PPD are affected by social stigma and are inclined to hide their clinical symptoms [28]. Therefore, developing appropriate predictive models can be helpful in quickly identifying perinatal women with PPD and facilitating supportive care or amelioration of the disease course before overt symptoms develop."

309,"Health Care Professionals' Views on the Use of Passive Sensing, AI, and Machine Learning in Mental Health Care: Systematic Review With Meta-Synthesis","These findings suggest that although clinicians are open-minded about the use of passive sensing and applied AI methods in mental health care, factors such as service user well-being, clinicians? workloads, and the therapeutic relationship need to be considered. It is important to involve both service users and clinicians in the development of digital technologies and systems to ensure their ease of use. The development of policies, training, and clear guidelines on the use of passive sensing and AI in mental health care, including risk management and data security procedures, will also be key to facilitating clinician engagement and wide-scale adoption. Means for clinicians and service users to provide feedback on how the use of passive sensing and AI in practice is being received should also be considered, allowing reflection on any impact there might be on the therapeutic relationship, service user well-being, and clinicians? workloads."
310,"Health Care Professionals' Views on the Use of Passive Sensing, AI, and Machine Learning in Mental Health Care: Systematic Review With Meta-Synthesis","Efforts were made to include all eligible studies in this review and to avoid neglecting potentially important findings, such as checking the reference lists of all papers and searching the databases again at a later date to identify further studies that might have been published. However, it is possible that some studies were overlooked, particularly as the terminology in this research area can be diverse and studies were only included if they were published in the English language in peer-reviewed journals, meaning that important contributions to the literature may have been missed because of language and publication bias. The included studies were conducted across different mental health settings, such as primary care and inpatient settings, and across different countries. It is important to note that the health care systems and services within them differ globally, so the generalizability of the results may be limited. However, meta-synthesis of qualitative studies can transform findings into highly abstracted and generalizable theoretical frameworks [21]."
311,"Health Care Professionals' Views on the Use of Passive Sensing, AI, and Machine Learning in Mental Health Care: Systematic Review With Meta-Synthesis","The final key issue is access. As highlighted in this review, access to technology could pose a barrier to engagement at both the service user and clinician level. For example, studies conducted in India have highlighted that not all hospitals offering mental health care have access to the internet. Therefore, considering the digital context within low- and middle-income countries, it is important to create digital-based mental health interventions intended for a global rollout. Indeed, Lee et al [54] highlighted that methods such as machine learning have the potential to advance health equity by supporting opportunities for equality in patient outcomes, performance, and resource allocation."
312,"Health Care Professionals' Views on the Use of Passive Sensing, AI, and Machine Learning in Mental Health Care: Systematic Review With Meta-Synthesis","Concerns have been raised across studies that service users may notice a decline in their mental health if they were to monitor aspects of their behavior and interpret subsequent passively collected data in such a way that increases anxiety or results in demotivation. Research has shown that tracking behavior can reduce enjoyment in walking-based activities [46] and increase eating disorder symptomology [47]. However, research has also found that the use of digital devices that allow passive sensing, such as wearables, can be a positive experience, with multiple psychological benefits identified by users, including increased sense of motivation and accountability [48]. Individual differences are therefore important for clinicians to consider, as certain characteristics may impact a service user?s ability to interpret their health data in a helpful way. For example, research has shown that high health literacy supports the understanding of passively collected health data and how to use it to work toward goals [49]."
313,"Health Care Professionals' Views on the Use of Passive Sensing, AI, and Machine Learning in Mental Health Care: Systematic Review With Meta-Synthesis","Across the papers reviewed, multiple ways in which passive sensing technology and applied AI methods could augment mental health care were identified, such as supporting service users in managing their mental health, improving diagnostic accuracy, monitoring treatment trajectories, and increasing access to timely support, thereby reducing the risk of relapse of mental health difficulties. Indeed, research has shown that passive data and AI methods have the potential to provide insight into service user behavior outside the clinic environment and provide real-time detection of behavioral anomalies, which could allow early identification and intervention before a deterioration in mental health [39]. However, despite the potential benefits, concerns have been raised that clinicians could become overreliant on digital technology in practice [40]. This could have negative consequences, as participants discussed that they may not be able to fully trust the data they receive because of service user influence and inaccurate sensors. Therefore, overreliance on inaccurate data can lead to misdiagnoses or missed diagnoses. Thus, decision-making should not be delegated to technology alone [41], and it is important for clinicians to acknowledge the limitations of objective data collection and applied AI methods to avoid tension between service users and clinicians [42]. This is particularly important, as research has shown that discrepancies between experience and tracking data can lead to upset, confusion, and disengagement [43], which may negatively impact the therapeutic relationship."
314,"Health Care Professionals' Views on the Use of Passive Sensing, AI, and Machine Learning in Mental Health Care: Systematic Review With Meta-Synthesis","Data management was therefore seen as an important consideration, and it was highlighted that service users should be given choice over what they share and be made aware of who could access the data, what will happen if their data are leaked [3], how their data will be kept private and secure, and what their data will be used for [10]:"

Those given stronger scores tended to provide more detail as to why certain qualitative approaches were selected over others, provided details regarding the sample including why participants may have opted not to take part, and ethical considerations were reported. It should be noted that although some studies did make some reference to the relationship between researcher and participants, this was the area that scored lowest, with few studies referencing bias and considering the influence their own roles may have had on results and reporting. For papers that included other stakeholders alongside mental health professionals, higher scores were given if the results were written to clearly distinguish which themes were associated with which participant group."
328,"Health Care Professionals' Views on the Use of Passive Sensing, AI, and Machine Learning in Mental Health Care: Systematic Review With Meta-Synthesis","The included studies were read and reread to ensure that they met the inclusion criteria. Key study information was then recorded, including the number and characteristics of participants, aims of the research, analysis method used, and the settings (Table 1). In addition, the original authors? analysis of primary qualitative data was extracted (second-order constructs), and individual participants? quotes were also noted (first-order constructs), in line with meta-synthesis principles [29]. An inductive thematic analysis approach within a critical realist epistemological framework was then taken with the aim of developing a cohesive, synthesized understanding of the data [30] and new interpretations [31]. JR completed the coding of the text and quotes using NVivo qualitative data analysis software (NVivo version 12, Lumivero). The constructs were then grouped into core themes. These themes were discussed by a broader research team, considering how each paper contributed to each core theme. The themes were then grouped into final higher-order themes, which were again reviewed and agreed upon by the research team. These themes are considered third-order constructs and allow for reflection on how each paper?s findings fit within the wider literature and for findings to extend beyond the original papers [21]. JR returned to the papers to ensure that the themes identified reflected the data and that other themes were not overlooked."
329,"Health Care Professionals' Views on the Use of Passive Sensing, AI, and Machine Learning in Mental Health Care: Systematic Review With Meta-Synthesis","Study quality was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) tool for quality appraisal in qualitative evidence synthesis (CASP, 2018, [26]), which assesses the strengths, limitations, relevance, and credibility of qualitative research. The CASP comprises 10 items that focus on different methodological aspects of qualitative studies, such as method, design, recruitment, data collection, and reflexivity. It is considered a good measure of transparency of research practice and reporting standards and is recommended for use in health-related research [27]; therefore, it was deemed appropriate for use in this review. A 3-point scale was used, with a score applied to each criterion (0=criterion not met, 1=criterion partially met, and 2=criterion totally met) [28]. Therefore, papers were given a total quality score of 20."
330,"Health Care Professionals' Views on the Use of Passive Sensing, AI, and Machine Learning in Mental Health Care: Systematic Review With Meta-Synthesis","A discussion within the research team and a review of the literature allowed for the identification of common terminology used in this research area and the selection of search terms. The search tool ?SPIDER? (sample, phenomenon of interest, design, evaluation, research type) was used to ensure that all relevant areas were covered when developing the search terms. Relevant studies were identified through systematic searches of the following electronic databases: AMED, PsycINFO, Embase, and Medline. The search terms were (clinician*) OR (health care professional*) OR (staff) OR (physician*) OR (provider*) OR (practitioner*) OR (psychologist*) OR (doctor*) OR (therapist*) OR (care coordinator*) OR (mental health nurse*) OR (psychiatric nurse*) OR (support worker*) OR (counsellor *) OR (case manager*) OR (GP*) AND (view*) OR (opinion*) OR (perception*) OR (qualitative) OR (interview*) AND (remote monitoring) OR (digital phenotyping) OR (machine learning) OR (passive sens*) OR (passive monitor*) OR (passive data) OR (artificial intelligence) OR (wearables). A manual search of references and citations from eligible articles was also performed by JR to identify additional studies. Papers were initially screened according to title and abstract, followed by a full article."

A systematic approach for identifying and assessing the quality of potential papers, followed by analysis of the data and synthesis, was used with the aim of understanding what mental health care professionals think about the use of passive sensing and AI in mental health care. The review protocol was developed and registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO CRD42022331698)."
332,"Health Care Professionals' Views on the Use of Passive Sensing, AI, and Machine Learning in Mental Health Care: Systematic Review With Meta-Synthesis","Despite the potential benefits, there remains a persistent gap between the rapid developments in digitally supported mental health care and the successful adoption of these tools in clinical practice [13]. A key driver to the potential success of digitally supported health care uptake is the willingness, confidence, and capacity of clinicians to make changes to their practice [9]. Resistance to incorporating digital approaches in clinical practice can occur for various reasons, including the lack of technological literacy, fear that AI models could replace professionals, and concerns about ethical and legal issues [6]. There is trepidation that core aspects of clinician roles, such as diagnosis, assessment, formulation and treatment, may be delegated to AI models without human input [14]. This has been viewed as dehumanizing and could have negative implications for therapeutic relationship [15]. Ethical issues have also been raised, such as implications for service user privacy and data security [16]. As clinicians? perceptions and attitudes pose a potential barrier to implementation [17], it is important that they are invited into the dialog around digitally supported AI in mental health care, to embrace any benefits there might be, as well as share their concerns and explore the limitations and risks [2]. However, it has been noted that stakeholder?s views are rarely considered in model design or evaluation in relation to machine learning approaches [18]. Indeed, professionals have felt that their knowledge and views have been disregarded in the design of digital health solutions or are only considered as an afterthought [19]. As the extent to which these methods can be successfully implemented in health care depends on their acceptability [3], research is needed to understand stakeholders? perspectives on digital health systems [11]."
333,"Health Care Professionals' Views on the Use of Passive Sensing, AI, and Machine Learning in Mental Health Care: Systematic Review With Meta-Synthesis","Although clinicians are open-minded about the use of passive sensing and AI in mental health care, important factors to consider are service user well-being, clinician workloads, and therapeutic relationships. Service users and clinicians must be involved in the development of digital technologies and systems to ensure ease of use. The development of, and training in, clear policies and guidelines on the use of passive sensing and AI in mental health care, including risk management and data security procedures, will also be key to facilitating clinician engagement. The means for clinicians and service users to provide feedback on how the use of passive sensing and AI in practice is being received should also be considered."

336,Understanding machine learning applications in dementia research and clinical practice: a review for biomedical scientists and clinicians,"Clinicians tend to prefer techniques that are transparent and interpretable, aligning with conventional clinical reasoning. One of the barriers for clinicians to trust and uptake the output of ML models is the opaque nature of these algorithms, often referred to as ""black boxes."" ML models can obscure the logic behind their complex decision-making processes, sometimes producing results that cannot be easily justified by existing biomedical knowledge. The ""black box"" nature of ML potentially erodes clinicians' trust, hindering the adoption of these models in clinical practice. In response to these challenges, there is an increasing focus on developing explainable AI techniques, such as Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) [121]. These methods aim to make the decision-making processes of ML models more transparent and understandable, thereby can potentially enhance trust among clinicians. Another significant challenge is that many clinicians have not received formal training in ML, which can hinder their ability to effectively use and explain these tools to patients [122]. Providing basic education about ML to clinicians and incorporating an AI/ML training component in medical school curriculum can enhance their ability to use innovative tools and communicate the benefits to patients. Of paramount importance, involving clinicians in the co-design of ML-dementia models can ensure AI/ML tools meet clinical needs and foster greater acceptance and integration into practice. Last but not least, some clinicians are hesitant to accept AI/ML tools due to concerns about job displacement [122]. However, it is essential to understand that AI/ML tools are designed to augment, not replace, the work of clinicians, similar to other diagnostic tests. Clinicians should be assured that their clinical judgment cannot be replaced by AI/ML and that the role of AI/ML in clinical practice should be clearly defined in relevant guidelines."
337,Understanding machine learning applications in dementia research and clinical practice: a review for biomedical scientists and clinicians,"The targeted population for ML-dementia tools is older adults, which raises questions about their readiness to accept these technological innovations [118]. Many older adults are not as technologically adept as younger generations, making it challenging for them to understand ML and its potential in diagnosing and managing diseases. This lack of understanding can result in low trust in ML-generated results, leading to hesitation in their use for healthcare purposes. Moreover, some ML tools collect data using wearable devices, raising privacy concerns among older adults who may be unsure how their data will be used. Furthermore, not all older adults want to receive predictions about their disease progression or early detection due to psychological fears and anxieties [119]."
338,Understanding machine learning applications in dementia research and clinical practice: a review for biomedical scientists and clinicians,"Computational and memory burden is another technical challenge to ML-dementia, particularly as recent studies focus on high-dimensional longitudinal omics data. Advanced tools such as the versatile toolbox MEFISTO [115] and the PALMO platform [116] are now capable of modelling spatial and temporal omics data. These tools utilize high-performance computing resources and implement various optimization strategies to improve processing efficiency. However, the high computational and memory demands of these algorithms can limit their applicability in AD studies that involve large sample sizes. Furthermore, the high volume of data requires a robust data management solution. Distributed computing platforms, like Apache Hadoop [117], can be employed to efficiently handle, store, and share the large-scale data, facilitating collaborative efforts across different research groups and locations. However, these platforms are not always affordable, creating a technical barrier."
339,Understanding machine learning applications in dementia research and clinical practice: a review for biomedical scientists and clinicians,"To enhance the performance of ML models in dementia research, addressing variability in data collection methods is crucial. The Alzheimer's Dementia Onset and Progression in International Cohorts initiative [111] exemplifies the successful application of data harmonization, integrating data from five international dementia cohort studies, including the Adult Children Study, ADNI, AIBL, the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network, and the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center. Similar initiatives should be encouraged, as they are crucial for enhancing statistical power, and enabling more robust ML applications in dementia, leveraging the existing longitudinal datasets. In addition, publication of sample collection protocols, along with raising awareness of the requirements and benefits of data pooling for ML among biomedical and clinician scientists, could promote consistent data collection practices and enhance collaborative research efforts globally. Of paramount importance, inconsistencies in data formats can undermine the effectiveness of ML models. Advanced tools like 'dtool' provide practical solutions for standardizing data formats and enhancing quality by encapsulating data and metadata into consistent, unified dataset structures with readily accessible metadata for both the collective dataset and its individual files [112]. Data repositories could endorse guidelines that only accept datasets meeting standardized criteria."
340,Understanding machine learning applications in dementia research and clinical practice: a review for biomedical scientists and clinicians,"The quality of clinical data used to train ML models directly impacts the soundness of the model. The diagnoses are performed by clinicians and neuropsychologists [101,�102], which can sometimes introduce human errors into the dataset. This is because diagnosis is complicated by that 1) preclinical AD is difficult to detect [103], 2) MCI can be misclassified [104], and 3) vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia are sometimes�misdiagnosed as ADem [105]. Moreover, some neuropsychological tests are influenced by practice effects [106] (repeated testing can artificially improve performance over time), and education background [107] (poor performance for individuals who are less educated), potentially skewing results. Furthermore, the trajectory of dementia varies significantly among individuals due to the complex interplays of age, genetics, sex, and other comorbidities [108]. Some individuals may experience a gradual decline in cognition over many years, while others show rapid deterioration. Many longitudinal studies employ an ""up-to-interval"" method [75], classifying participants into CU, MCI, ADem, and non-ADem within a specified follow-up period. However, this approach often falls short in capturing the disease trajectory of individuals experiencing gradual cognitive decline. In addition, older participants are more likely to withdraw from the study due to their dependency on others (e.g., reduced mobility discourage their participation), leading to their disease trajectory not fully captured. Cohort study designs can be enhanced to improve data quality. Longitudinal study designs should consider incorporating more objective�diagnostic criteria, such as expanding the use of A? PET scans, and integration of blood-based biomarkers, tau, and neuroinflammation markers, to enhance the assessments accuracy. Additionally, developing strategies to prolong study follow-up duration is crucial for capturing the full progression of disease states over time. Research funding bodies could play a crucial role in driving this progress by prioritizing investment and providing support to longitudinal studies."
341,Understanding machine learning applications in dementia research and clinical practice: a review for biomedical scientists and clinicians,"ML has been applied to clinical data analysis for more than two decades, and its widespread adoption in clinical research and healthcare has noticeably accelerated. This section will discuss the technical barriers, and the anticipated challenges and potential solutions to applying ML in clinical practice for dementia (summarized in Table�8)."
342,Understanding machine learning applications in dementia research and clinical practice: a review for biomedical scientists and clinicians,"ML models have shown promise in predicting AD biomarkers with reasonable accuracy (Table�7D). For predicting A? and p-tau levels in the brain, the problem is often simplified into a binary classification, e.g., normal vs high or negative vs positive. Langford et al. [85] employed the extreme gradient boosting algorithm, a scalable tree boosting model to predict A? PET positivity (standardized uptake values � 1.15) from demographics (age, education, gender�and family history), four neuropsychological tests and APOE genotype., An AUC of 0.74 was achieved. Palmqvist et al. [84] used plasma A?42/ A?40�ratios, APOE genotype, and neuropsychological tests for a logistic regression with a lasso penalty model, and achieved an AUC of 0.83. In contrast, Lew et. al. [88] employed a logistic regression model for binary prediction of PET results (high versus low A? or p-tau) using MRI and other data (e.g., demographic, APOE genotype, neuropsychological tests and hippocampal volumes etc.). This resulted in an AUC of 0.79 for A? and 0.73 for p-tau. Using a seven-layer neural network, 3,635 plasma proteins, age and APOE genotype for the same prediction, Zhang et al. [89] achieved a lower AUC score for A? (AUC?=?0.78) and p-tau (AUC?=?0.67). Their performance is relatively lower than the other studies, which could possibly be due to high feature-to-sample ratio (3000 proteins in 800 participants), which can complicate model training and validation."
343,Understanding machine learning applications in dementia research and clinical practice: a review for biomedical scientists and clinicians,"For disease trajectory simulation, Bucholc et al. [82] has combined unsupervised and supervised learning techniques, where participants were categorized by their cognitive score trajectories (stable vs deterioration over 2?3�years). The trajectories of each category were then analyzed using random forest, support vector machine, and linear regression (supervised). This approach achieved a?~?90% accuracy in predicting seven different neuropsychological test scores over 1-year and 2-year intervals, from the correspondent baseline scores. A more complex model, Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks, was used by Mukherji et al. [81] to simulate the trajectory for five neuropsychological tests. This model achieved a prediction accuracy of 85 and 83% for 2-year and 4-year, respectively. Recent work has also focused on dynamically predicting the risk of dementia onset. This is typically achieved using a Cox model, combined with functional data analysis to model longitudinal neuropsychological outcomes. For example, Jiang et al. [76] utilized the functional ensemble random survival forest to characterize the joint effects of neuropsychological evaluation in predicting disease progression, specifically to predict the time to AD conversion in individuals with MCI and to provide personalized dynamic predictions. This approach achieved an AUC of approximately 0.90 over an average follow-up period of 31�months. Similarly, Zou et al. [83] proposed a multivariate functional mixed model framework to simultaneously model multiple longitudinal neuropsychological outcomes and the time to dementia onset, achieving an integrated AUC of over 0.80, with the mean time to visit being 1.12�years."
344,Understanding machine learning applications in dementia research and clinical practice: a review for biomedical scientists and clinicians,"We noted that model development in most of these studies were challenged by an imbalanced dataset, with AD and MCI often being underrepresented compared to CU individuals due to disease prevalence. Interestingly, Naz et al. [71] manually balanced the dataset by eliminating some of the CU participant data (CU?=?95, MCI?=?146, ADem?=?95). However, this approach reduces the overall dataset size, possibly leading to the model not capturing all critical features for accurate classification [93]. Model overfitting is also expected from using such a small dataset [94]. Future studies could focus on enriching AD and MCI participant data; however, this is currently less practical due to a lack of harmonized datasets that allows data pooling. An alternative approach is to intentionally recruit MCI and ADem participants, as done by Kwak et al. [77]; however, these data may be less suitable for studying the onset and progression of AD. Another major issue is that the classification accuracy is usually less satisfactory for differentiating MCI from AD, as has been reported by Wang et al. [69] and Naz et al. [71]. Using multimodal data could be a potential solution [70], nonetheless, future studies are required to confirm whether�their observations are�dataset dependent."
345,Understanding machine learning applications in dementia research and clinical practice: a review for biomedical scientists and clinicians,"Although these studies achieved high diagnostic accuracies (~?80%), only Nguyen et al. [66] validated their model using an external dataset. This raises concerns about the generalizability of these findings and suggests that potential cohort bias cannot be ruled out. It is crucial to further validate these models prior to clinical trial and implementation. Moreover, these studies appear to focus on the differential diagnosis between vascular dementia and ADem (Qiang et al. [67] and Catellazzi et al. [92]) and between frontotemporal dementia and ADem (Nguyen et al. [66]). Future research could explore the possibility of differentiating multiple subtypes of dementia using a single model. Furthermore, all these studies, except Qiang et al. [67], leveraged advanced imaging techniques to capture intricate details of the brain. The reliance on high-resolution imaging data necessitates substantial resources, making it challenging to implement the new technology in clinics."
346,Understanding machine learning applications in dementia research and clinical practice: a review for biomedical scientists and clinicians,"The following section reviews ML models using input data collected via non-/moderately invasive approaches. These data include demographics (age, gender, ethnicity, family history), medical history, neuropsychological evaluation, blood (omics, biomarkers), and brain imaging. Studies published between 2019 and 2024 were selected based on uniqueness in methodology, which is summarized in Table�7�and Fig.�3."
347,Understanding machine learning applications in dementia research and clinical practice: a review for biomedical scientists and clinicians,"Several observational dementia datasets have been used for ML model construction and validation�(Table�1), such as the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle (AIBL) study [57] and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study [13]. These datasets are often longitudinal, involving thousands of participants, spanning several decades with regular follow-ups, and some are still actively recruiting. These datasets feature a diverse range of participant demographics, typically focusing on middle-aged adults from various racial,�ethnic�and educational backgrounds. Each dataset has a distinct focus. For instance, Open Access Series of Imaging Studies [OASIS] [16] concentrate on brain imaging, while the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project [ROSMAP] [9] aim to understand aging processes. Data collection and testing within the same dataset can vary depending on the project's phases or aims. For example, ADNI adapts its data collection strategies across five phases, and OASIS divides its datasets to address specific research goals. While most datasets listed in Table�1�primarily address AD, others such as the UK Biobank [15] and the Framingham Heart Study [6], provide a broader insight across various health outcomes within larger cohorts."
348,Understanding machine learning applications in dementia research and clinical practice: a review for biomedical scientists and clinicians,"Since then, ML or deep learning, a subset of ML that uses neural network to simulate the learning process of human [54], has been used to classify disease subtypes and stages. Similar to how the human brain employs interconnected neurons for information processing, neural networks in ML use nodes (artificial neurons) and their interconnections to mimic the brain's structure and functionality. This design facilitates pattern recognition and decision-making. For instance, Ramzan et al. [55] utilizes resting-state function MRI with Residual Network architecture to classify AD�into: CU, significant memory concern, early-MCI, MCI, late-MCI, and ADem. In more recent years, the adoption of advanced deep learning architectures, such as time-series models has expanded. For example, hybrid deep learning frameworks based on Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory models leverage multimodal data (i.e., MRI, PET, and neuropsychological evaluation) to enhance the classification of CU and early MCI [56]. A timeline summarizing the use of ML in dementia research is presented in Fig.�1."
349,Understanding machine learning applications in dementia research and clinical practice: a review for biomedical scientists and clinicians,"Traditional statistical methods include a hypothesis-driven approach and statical inference (i.e., generalizing findings from a subset of data to a large population). Such approach relies on strong assumptions about the data, e.g., the data follows a�normal distribution to fit existing theoretical models [50]. However, these traditional statistical methods often encounter practical challenges in complex real-world scenarios, as the assumptions made may not be satisfied in clinical practice [2]. In contrast, ML adopts a more data-driven approach with minimal assumptions, and it concentrates on prediction rather than inference [2]. However, statistical models and ML techniques sometimes overlap; e.g., both methods often employ linear and logistic regression models to meet statistical goals or to achieve simple linear predictions in ML contexts. It must be noted that ML possesses the capability to process and analyze extensive and complex datasets, such as omics data, effectively uncovering patterns or capturing interactions that might be omitted or overlooked by the traditional statistical analysis [2]. Therefore, ML is often beneficial to clinical research, where data is inherently multidimensional with a diverse array of variables."
350,Understanding machine learning applications in dementia research and clinical practice: a review for biomedical scientists and clinicians,"Unsupervised learning operates on unlabelled data, which focuses on uncovering patterns or relationships without considering any predefined labels. This approach includes 1) clustering tasks such as identifying subtypes of dementia based on biological, neuropsychological, and demographic features and 2) data compression such as using principal component analysis to simplify and summarize complex data."
351,Understanding machine learning applications in dementia research and clinical practice: a review for biomedical scientists and clinicians,"ML includes a variety of algorithms designed to learn from data to meet a predefined goal, such as identifying patterns or making predictions about future states. The model updates its settings or '(hyper-)parameters' based on feedback from performance metrics known as 'loss functions', which assesses the accuracy of the model's predictions compared to actual outcomes. Once the model is optimally trained, it can use real-world data to achieve the predefined task [46]. ML techniques are primarily divided into three categories: unsupervised learning, supervised learning, and reinforcement learning, with the first two being more commonly used in dementia research. These categories are discussed in detail below and their advantages and limitations are summarized in Table�3."
352,Understanding machine learning applications in dementia research and clinical practice: a review for biomedical scientists and clinicians,"The development of anti-A? monoclonal antibodies, such as donanemab [40] and lecanemab [41], has shown promising results in reducing cognitive decline in early treatment scenarios. This underscores the importance of timely intervention.�ML can enhance early detection accuracy and personalized stimulation by determining the�most effective timepoint to adminster antibodies in the right patients, thereby maximizing their therapeutic benefits. However, it must be noted that while ML can aid in identifying individuals likely to benefit, our global health systems are not fully equipped to provide these early interventions. Monoclonal antibodies require costly monitoring for brain bleeds, which presents challenges not only in funding the necessary scans but also in accessing scanners within a reasonable distance for patients. A recent study showed that novel biomarkers including microRNAs, metabolites and proteins have been identified using ML approaches [42]. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that patient-level simulations by ML can predict disease trajectories [43], estimate the likelihood of transitioning from MCI to ADem [44] or even successfully forecast the time-to-event outcomes survival probability for MCI participants [45]."
353,Understanding machine learning applications in dementia research and clinical practice: a review for biomedical scientists and clinicians,"Alzheimer?s disease (AD), the major cause of dementia, is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that predominantly affects older people [1]. The accumulation of amyloid-beta (A?) and formation of neurofibrillary tangles marked by tau phosphorylation in the brain are the key hallmarks of AD [1]. Clinically, the disease can be divided into three stages: 1) preclinical AD i.e., cognitive unimpaired (CU) people with amyloid accumulation in the brain, 2) prodromal or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 3) Alzheimer?s dementia (ADem) [1]. This disease trajectory can vary between individuals, and preclinical AD can occur 15?20�years prior to ADem [1]."
354,Understanding machine learning applications in dementia research and clinical practice: a review for biomedical scientists and clinicians,"Several (inter)national longitudinal dementia observational datasets encompassing demographic information, neuroimaging, biomarkers, neuropsychological evaluations, and muti-omics data, have ushered in a new era of potential for integrating machine learning (ML) into dementia research and clinical practice. ML, with its proficiency in handling multi-modal and high-dimensional data, has emerged as an innovative technique to facilitate early diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and to predict onset and progression of mild cognitive impairment and dementia. In this review, we evaluate current and potential applications of ML, including its history in dementia research, how it compares to traditional statistics, the types of datasets it uses and the�general workflow. Moreover, we identify the technical barriers and challenges of ML implementations in clinical practice. Overall, this review provides a comprehensive understanding of ML with non-technical explanations for broader accessibility to biomedical scientists and clinicians."
355,A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media,"Although our dataset contains a comprehensive number of media items, the size of the training dataset for specific characteristics remains a limitation of our study, as it crucially determines the performance of machine learning, in particular deep learning model [27,�28]. Especially potentially protective characteristics are not often mentioned in the media, which makes achieving high sample sizes for these characteristics challenging, but also the most promising avenue for future research and prevention efforts. This will require collecting broadcast items over longer time horizons or larger regions than our study, which included a time period of 12 months in two US states. Alternatively, different existing datasets could be merged. Care should be taken to not generalize from our results to data from other regions and time periods, without first evaluating the performance of our machine learning models there. Furthermore, we have only assessed a small number of media characteristics, far below the 39 characteristics listed in current media recommendations for suicide reporting [3]. Yet, we included several classification types, including both more information related and more subjective ones. Given that performance seemed mostly related to class size rather than the type of characteristic, it seems plausible that machine learning methods based on sufficiently large samples are effective tools for automatically labeling suicide-related content. Beyond the methods used in this paper, there are other standard machine learning approaches (e.g., naive bayesian classifier) that we have not used in the present study. The approaches selected were based on a master?s thesis conducted by one of the authors (HB) [32]. In the thesis, regarding traditional natural language processing, the na�ve classifier as a trivial model and Bag.of-Words were used in addition to Tf-idf with SVM. Both of these approaches, however, were far too simplistic to capture the complexity of the present tasks."
356,A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media,"From a suicide prevention standpoint, the current machine learning approach developed in this work is particularly relevant when it comes to the assessment and categorization of large quantities of media items that would normally be retrieved with keyword searches only. As noted previously, searches based solely on keywords have the considerable disadvantage of mixing together entirely different narratives such as media items about celebrity suicide and suicide prevention items or items about hope and recovery [4]. The evaluation metrics of the present work clearly show that the present approach is superior to that type of keyword searching. In particular, the current findings appear helpful to make differentiations regarding characteristics that have been sufficiently represented in the current media items. This includes the determination A) if the item is about suicide reporting or not; B) includes information on celebrity suicide vs. not; C) the absence of any of the binary characteristics that were assessed (but not necessarily their presence), D) if the focus is placed on the problem or prevention of suicide; and E) if the main focus is about suicide death."
357,A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media,"Yet, at the same time, BERT often still achieved higher precision than Tf-idf with SVM for these rare positive classes. Compared to Tf-idf with SVM, BERT?s precision was most clearly better (by .15-.20) for moncausality, suicidal ideation and enhancing myths. This may hint that connotation of words, their context, and syntax matters more for these than other tasks, possibly because such descriptions are more subjective and nuanced, and simple word frequencies cannot capture this as well. Finally, BERT seemed to generalize better in the multi-class task of detecting the main focus of a text. Possibly, the ability of deep learning models to rely less on specific features of datasets helped BERT to generalize better for complex and multi-class classification tasks like detecting the main focus of a text. Taken together, the potential advantages of deep learning over word-frequency based models could not fully play out given the size of positive classes in our training data set. Still, they were recognizable in generalization abilities when training on few samples for multiple classes, and in higher precision for rarer characteristics that may require detecting nuance and changes in the meaning of words in particular contexts."
358,A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media,"For other classification tasks, e.g. suicidal ideation, comparisons with other samples are much more difficult, particularly because of the nature of the text analyzed. Several studies have investigated suicidal online communication and have applied machine learning particularly in order to differentiate suicidal from non-suicidal users [29?31]. Many of these models performed better as compared to the present model, which is likely due to their considerably larger sample sizes positive for suicidal ideation as compared to the present analysis."
359,A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media,"A third characteristic classified with high precision and recall (>.90) was the problem focus of a broadcast item. This is particularly encouraging, since problem focus was one out of four classes, and requires detecting what a text focuses on, rather than just whether a characteristic is present. This suggests that many characteristics of similar complexity can be recognized with machine learning tools, as long as sufficiently large training samples can be put together. Good classification performance for suicide death as one out of 14 possible main foci of broadcast items (BERT�F1�= .76) further underlines this encouraging finding. It demonstrates that even 14 class classification problems can be solved reasonably well with as little as 400 training examples. A fifth case, solution focus, is a similar case: with only around 300 training samples, precision was around .70 in this four-class classification problem. In sum, the good performance for several complex characteristics, that require predicting which of many possible areas is the focus of a text, suggest that training models on larger samples is a very promising avenue for future research."
360,A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media,"For certain characteristics, our classifiers achieved high classification performances. The primary factor explaining these high performances, as well as the difference in performance across classification tasks, seemed to be the number of labeled examples for models to train on. Instead, if a classification required recognizing the narrative or the emotional connotation and meaning of a broadcast item, or the mere detection vs. the extent to which a characteristic was described, seemed less important. Given the importance of sample size, sound conclusions are possible only for categories that include a sufficient number of broadcast items. The first of these are all negative classes in binary tasks (a characteristic was absent), which were predicted and detected with scores above .90. This suggests that about 1250 examples may be enough to achieve highly reliable machine learning classification for suicide-related media content. Positive classes (a characteristic is present) were usually the minority class, with below 250 training samples, and their performance scores thus low (F1�= .4-.6) Nevertheless, the high performances for predicting the absence of these same binary characteristics suggest that machine learning models can in principle achieve very satisfactory results. The only required prerequisite seems to be more training examples for broadcast items that mention a characteristic, that is, the positive class in each task."
361,A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media,"The current study evaluated automatic labeling methods to categorize specific suicide-related content in broadcast media (i.e. radio and TV), as well as online media with machine learning. Based on a comprehensive annotation scheme for suicide-related content, we selected some content characteristics, aiming to include various classification types and difficulty levels that are relevant based on media guidelines for the reporting of suicide [3]. We then tested the ability of different machine learning models to accurately classify these characteristics, which is relevant for both research in the area of media effects as well as for surveillance efforts of suicide-related broadcast media content."
362,A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media,"Further, an interesting pattern across positive classes in binary tasks (except suicide death) is the generally lower recall of BERT (around .40), but often higher precision. For example, Tf-idf with SVM had a recall advantage over BERT was .22 for monocausality, .17 for alternatives to suicide, and even .40 for enhancing myths (.40). This suggests that the recall metric of BERT was especially sensitive to small class sizes, while precision did not suffer as much. BERT?s precision scores were most clearly better (by .15-.20) than Tf-idfs with SVM for moncausality, suicidal ideation and enhancing myths. Possibly, these are tasks where connotation of words, their context, and syntax matters more than for other tasks."
363,A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media,"Pearson?s correlation coefficients between class size and performance scores are shown in�Table 1. Correlations are reported across all categories, and for the subset of categories with a minimal number of 50 transcripts in order to exclude unreliable outlier performance scores which are based on very few labeled examples. This threshold of 50 in the training set corresponds to 15 in the test set. Applying it excludes the categories problem vs. solution focus = neither, and main focus = assisted suicide, cluster, healing story and suicidal ideation. Removing these unreliable performance scores results in correlations around .7?0.8 for both models and metrics."
364,A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media,"The pattern of high performance for the negative majority class, and low performance for the rare positive class, clearly indicates that the number of texts the models could learn from had a large influence on performance scores. Indeed,�Fig 4�shows strong correlations between sample size per class and precision as well as recall for both models. For class sizes above 250, performance increases steeply and linearly; for lower class sizes, performance and class size are not clearly related. The scatter plots thus reveal that sample size can explain many of the differences in classification performances between classes, in particular for class sizes above 250. Performance and sample size for the negative category is lower for suicide death (the lonely red dot outside the red at n = 703) than all other binary tasks. For positive categories, performance scores for suicide death (blue dot at n = 909) is higher than for almost all positive categories in binary tasks. Only the positive class celebrity suicide (blue dots at performance around .85-.95) can be classified even better despite lower sample size (n = 209 in training set), likely thanks to celebrity names as highly indicative keywords."
365,A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media,"Fig 1�shows the proportion of transcripts per manually coded category for all characteristics, on average across the entire dataset.�S4 Table�reports the absolute frequency and proportion of transcripts per category separately for the training, validation, and test datasets. Since most texts only contain a few characteristics, the positive instance (the characteristic is present in the media item) is usually a minority class for all binary classification tasks (Fig 1A). Positive instances made up 6 to 14% of all transcripts for binary tasks (class size median = 51.0, min = 28, max = 284 in the test set), with suicide death mentions being the only exception (56.4%, n = 909 training set, n = 284 test set). For the type of narrative (Fig 1B), 57.9% (n = 884 training set, n = 277 test set) of transcripts described suicide predominantly as a problem, whereas 21.2% (n = 324 training set, n = 101 test set) focused on solutions, and 19.4% (n = 296 training set, n = 93 test set) emphasized both aspects equally."
366,A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media,"We report macro-averages for all scores and all models in the validation and test sets. For intraclass performance scores, we provide scores for the best two models, TF-IDF and BERT. We do not report accuracy scores, because our dataset contains mostly characteristics with large imbalances in the sample size between different classes. In such cases, accuracy can be very high even if a classifier always predicts the majority class, and is therefore a biased estimate."
367,A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media,The F1-score summarizes precision and recall as the harmonic mean.
368,A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media,"We indicate precision, recall, and their harmonic mean (the F1�score) for each classification task, all of which range from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating high performance. Precision is calculated by dividing the predictions for a specific category (for example, all transcripts labeled as mentioning a characteristic, such as suicide death) by all predictions (for example, those mentioning plus those not mentioning suicide death). It thus indicates how often the model?s label for this specific class is correct."
369,A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media,"We used the pre-trained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) base-uncased-model [23], and fine-tuned a separate model for each classification task (i.e., characteristic). BERT is a deep learning language model of the transformer architecture by Google AI. It has 12 transformer layers, 12 self-attention heads, and a hidden size of 768. Its pre-training included a masked language modeling task: a randomly chosen 15% of words in a sentence are masked, and the model learns to predict them from the sequences of words before and after the mask. Additionally, BERT was pre-trained to predict if a sentence follows a given sentence."

373,A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media,"We assumed classification tasks at level 1 would depend on detection of a few keywords, and thus be easiest. Indeed, Tf-idf with SVM and BERT reached classification performances above .80 for these tasks, and even above .90 for celebrity suicide. Performance scores for level 2 tasks, which we assumed to rely on detection of a larger and more varied set of keywords, were generally around .75, with some better exceptions. For instance, positive outcomes of a suicidal crisis were classified with very high precision (.90) by both models, and monocausal explanations were classified with high precision by BERT (.83). Tasks with level 3 difficulty, which we presumed to rely on the detection of emotional connotation and meaning, were not all clearly more difficult than level 2 tasks for the models. Especially healing stories were as well recognized as other level 2 features by both models (around 0.75 for all balanced metrics). Performance for texts that enhance myths about suicide was similarly good with Tf-idf with SVM (F1�= .75), whereas BERT?s performance suffered from low recall (.57). Detecting suicidal ideation, which we had assumed to be a level 3 difficulty task, turned out to be more difficult (F1�= .70) than determining the problem vs. solution narrative in a transcript (an assumed level 4 task). Despite having four classes and requiring a comparison between the emphasis on problem vs. solution, Tf-idf?s with SVM F1�was .74 and BERT?s F1�was .77."
374,A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media,"Fig 2�illustrates that both Tf-idf with SVM and BERT clearly outperformed the naive majority classifier in all classification tasks. In the following, we therefore focus on BERT and Tf-idf with SVM performances.�Fig 2�shows that their performances do not differ substantially for all classification tasks and metrics. In general (but not always), BERT reached higher precision, whereas Tf-idf with SVM reached higher recall for level 2 and 3 classification tasks. As F1-scores are a balance of these two, they are overall rather similar for BERT and Tf-idf with SVM."
375,A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media,Term-frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) represents text by assigning a weight to each word in a document (transcript) based on how often it appears in this document and how uncommon it is across all documents in a corpus. We used a small modification to the standard formula for TF-IDF by adding 1 in both the numerator and denominator. This change guarantees that every word appears at least once and prevents division by zero [22]:
376,A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media,We used different text representations and models to classify transcripts:
377,A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media,"We apply standard preprocessing strategies. see e.g., [21]. We converted the PDF files into text files using the Linux package pdftotext (https://pdftotext.com/). The original transcripts contained metadata about the radio/TV channel, the time of broadcast, a unique identifier (ID), and the transcribed broadcast. We first separated these metadata from the text using Python, and focused on analysis of the broadcasted text only for all following analyses. Input for BERT (one of the models we trained) is limited to a sequence length of 512 tokens, with remaining tokens being cut off, resulting in information loss. We compensated for this loss by training the word-frequency based models (see below) on the full sequences and comparing their performances to BERT. The majority of the 2519 transcripts in the final sample (83.2%) were shorter than 512 tokens, with a mean length of 316, the 95th�percentile at 944, and the 99th�percentile at 1411 tokens."
378,A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media,"One study suggests that the framing of suicide as a problem versus solution might have a different effect on the audience. Although this study did not reveal any significant findings for suicide-related outcomes, it identified that individuals reading problem-focused items were more likely to think about concepts related to death and dying as compared to individuals reading prevention-focused media items.18�Regarding the main focus of the media item, some focus areas, most importantly healing stories, have been found to be associated with decreases in suicides subsequently [6]. Stories with a main focus on suicide death might be associated with increases in suicides [5]. The detection of the overarching main focus is of high relevance to suicide prevention research and is a complex task based on the sheer number of frequent main content categories. Note that the detection of the main focus is different from other aspects listed above in that the main focus is about the most relevant focal areas of all areas tackled in the text. For example, presence of a healing story is one of the twelve categories but also listed above as a separate characteristic under level 3. In the ?main focus? section, only healing stores that make the most important overall focus of the entire item would qualify. Any inclusion of a healing story, no matter which prominence it has within the specific media item, would qualify for ?healing story? in the level 3 task."
379,A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media,"Problem vs. solution narrative (4 classes):�If the text focuses mainly on suicidal behavior or ideation as a problem, or shows how to find solutions and tackle the problem. If both aspects are described, we compared the emphasis on each in terms of the quantity of devoted text, but also investigated the prominence/framing of both. If they were balanced, we coded both; if neither was mentioned, neither.18"
380,A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media,One study has identified a positive association of portraying public misconceptions related to suicide with subsequent suicides [6].
381,A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media,There are several randomized controlled trials that indicate that healing stories and positive outcomes of suicidal crises have been found to be associated with reductions in suicidal ideation among vulnerable individuals [9].
382,A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media,"Suicidal ideation:�The text includes information about suicidal ideation as one of its focus areas. Suicidal ideation is the most serious type of suicidal experience mentioned, it is not accompanied by suicide or suicide attempts. Previous studies have found that stories about suicidal ideation in the absence of suicidal behaviours were associated with small decreases in suicides subsequently [6]."
383,A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media,"There has not been any conclusive evidence about how these reporting characteristics are associated with suicide. Not all of them have been found to be associated with suicides in previous analyses investigating associations of specific media content characteristics and suicide.[6,�13?15]. Nevertheless, such as the suggestion to highlight alternatives for readers and viewers who might be suicidal and to avoid portraying oversimplified reasons for suicide frequently receive specific consideration in media training and have therefore been included in this analysis [3]."

We assumed this to be binary classification tasks that distinguish between two classes that most likely depend on a rather diverse set of keywords, because different types of keywords may qualify an observation as a positive instance. This often applies for meta-categorical items, which code if one specific example for a type of content is mentioned, e.g., if the text mentions one of multiple possible prevention actions or warning signs. The class depends on what is present, but multiple different contents qualify as a positive instance. We selected the following characteristics for this category:"

389,A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media,"Authors ZL, and BT independently coded a random selection of items for each characteristic. Their intercoder-reliability for each characteristic was assessed in terms of percent agreement and Cohen Kappa coefficients. By the end of the process, all codes had substantial agreement (minimum percent agreement: 85%; minimum Kappa: 0.62) with most codes clearly outperforming these minimums. Mean percent agreement was 92.4%; mean Kappa: 0.87. The code book with code definitions and coding examples is provided in�S2 Table�[14]."
390,A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media,"We developed a coding system to assess the quality of media items. The content analysis built on previous analytic approaches for print and online media conducted by members of the study team and was based on the most current versions of media recommendations for the reporting of suicide [3,�6,�13]."
391,A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media,"For the present research, we build on previous studies by using a comprehensive human annotation scheme that systematically identifies selected putatively harmful and protective characteristics in broadcast reports about suicide. We selected a number of reporting characteristics from media recommendations for suicide, starting with a difficulty level that we assumed to be more simple (e.g., identifying a report on a celebrity suicide), to increasingly difficult classification tasks (e.g., identifying stories of healing) and ultimately, highly complex tasks such as the identification of the main focus of a news item. Using this selection of content characteristics with different difficulty levels for classification, we want to assess the feasibility of current machine learning approaches for the detection of suicide-related media reporting characteristics."
392,A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media,"In order to prevent harm from media reporting on suicide, screening for proactive identification of media reporting has been identified as a priority in suicide prevention [2,�3]. In case of reporting that might do harm, media screening can speed up the process of identifying media reports and potentially distributing media reaching out to media professionals. Such screening, however, has been hampered by the considerable resources needed for content analytic work. Machine learning approaches to automatically detect specific media reporting characteristics might be helpful in this regard. Further, automatic detection of reporting characteristics across a large body of media items would also help with building the evidence base for specific media recommendations, as this would increase the feasibility of testing of how specific media reporting characteristics are associated with suicide and other important outcomes, such as help-seeking."
393,A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media,"Current estimates suggest that approximately 700,000 individuals die by suicide each year, making suicide a priority in mental health research and prevention [1]. There are a variety of prevention approaches that have been widely used and recommended, with media reporting about suicide being one of the focal areas in most suicide prevention programmes and strategies [2,�3]. Research suggests that media can influence suicidal thoughts and feelings and potentially, suicidal behaviours in vulnerable individuals, in both a harmful and beneficial direction. For example, a recent-meta-analysis shows evidence for increases of suicides after news about celebrity deaths by suicide within two months after the death, making the reporting of celebrity suicide a core characteristic considered to carry some risk of harmful effects [4]. Specifically, after the reporting of celebrity suicides, suicide rates tend to increase by 13% in one to two subsequent months [4]. Imitation of suicidal behavior such as after celebrity suicide news is commonly referred to as the Werther effect [5]. Studies suggest that other types of media content may have a protective effect. With regard to positive media effects, the strongest evidence exists for stories of hope and recovery from psychosocial crises and suicidal thoughts [6?9]. A recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials suggests that media stories that feature individuals who managed to cope with their adversity and suicidal thoughts lead to a small-sized reduction in suicidal thoughts [8]. This beneficial media effect has been coined the Papageno effect and has received increasing attention in prevention and research over the last decade [6]."

The randomization process involves a computer-generated sequence, ensuring an unbiased assignment of participants into the intervention group (n?=?25) and the control group (n?=?25). Stratification is conducted based on key variables such as age, gender, and specific mental health diagnoses to maintain comparable groups. This methodology is critical for mitigating potential confounding factors and ensuring the validity of the study results. In the intervention group, each participant receives a personalized exercise prescription tailored by the AI system, based on their unique health profile. This approach aims to maximize the efficacy of the exercise regimen in improving mental health outcomes.

Additionally, this research underscores the superiority of current AI technology over traditional methods in exercise prescription. AI systems offer a higher degree of personalization and adaptability, leveraging real-time data to tailor exercise plans more effectively to individual needs and conditions. This approach signifies a significant shift from traditional, generalized exercise guidelines to more individualized, data-driven strategies."
411,Evaluating machine learning-enabled and multimodal data-driven exercise prescriptions for mental health: a randomized controlled trial protocol,"The field of exercise prescription for mental illness has garnered increasing attention in recent years, as evidenced by a growing body of research. Studies have consistently demonstrated the efficacy of regular physical activity in alleviating symptoms of various mental disorders, including depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia (8?11). For example, a meta-analysis by Rosenbaum et al. indicated that moderate to vigorous physical activity could significantly reduce depressive symptoms in adults (12). Despite these advancements, several challenges and gaps remain in the application of exercise prescription for mental health. A primary concern is the lack of individualization in exercise regimes. Most existing studies and protocols adopt a one-size-fits-all approach, neglecting the unique needs, preferences, and limitations of individual patients (13). This generalized approach may lead to suboptimal outcomes and lower adherence rates, as patients may find the prescribed exercises either too challenging or not engaging enough. Another significant limitation is the scarcity of data-driven methods in tailoring exercise prescriptions. While some studies have begun to explore the use of data in optimizing exercise interventions (14,�15), there is still a considerable gap in integrating comprehensive, multimodal data ? such as genetic, physiological, and behavioral information ? to inform exercise prescriptions. This lack of integration results in missed opportunities to enhance the precision and effectiveness of exercise as a therapeutic tool for mental health."

413,Evaluating machine learning-enabled and multimodal data-driven exercise prescriptions for mental health: a randomized controlled trial protocol,"The study is conducted in two phases. Initially, 1,000 participants will be recruited for AI model training and testing, with 800 forming the training set, augmented by 9,200 simulated samples generated by ChatGPT, and 200 as the testing set. Data annotation will be performed by experienced physicians from the Department of Mental Health at Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital. Subsequently, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 40 participants will be conducted to compare the AI-driven exercise prescriptions against standard care. Assessments will be scheduled at 6, 12, and 18?months to evaluate cognitive, physical, and psychological outcomes."
414,Evaluating machine learning-enabled and multimodal data-driven exercise prescriptions for mental health: a randomized controlled trial protocol,"Mental illnesses represent a significant global health challenge, affecting millions with far-reaching social and economic impacts. Traditional exercise prescriptions for mental health often adopt a one-size-fits-all approach, which overlooks individual variations in mental and physical health. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) offer an opportunity to tailor these interventions more effectively."
415,Patient Perspectives on AI for Mental Health Care: Cross-Sectional Survey Study,"Our study was limited in that the sample was recruited using a web-based platform, which may not generalize to those with technology, literacy, and other barriers to web-based survey completion. The sample was representative of the adult US population in terms of age, gender, and race distributions (Prolific/academic researchers), leading to most of the survey respondents being White due to >70% due to the US demographic makeup (US Census Bureau [64]). Therefore, important perspectives from other racial and ethnic groups may be limited. Our results may also be subject to response bias, as those who had strong feelings regarding topics pertaining to AI, mental health, or their intersection may have been more likely to respond. For example, a higher-than-anticipated proportion of respondents (215/500, 43%) reported having a history of mental illness. We did attempt to control for this in RQ 1, and the history of mental illness was not found to significantly affect responses regarding participants? perceived benefits of AI for mental health care. We, however, did not have a mechanism for evaluating how preexisting attitudes of AI may have affected responses, and this may be addressed with validated measures of AI attitudes in future surveys (Schepman and Rodway [65]). Given the scope of this paper, we were unable to assess sociodemographic differences (eg, based on race and literacy) across all outcomes. Future work may use this or other data sets to provide a more nuanced picture of differing views related to specific questions regarding AI for mental health."
416,Patient Perspectives on AI for Mental Health Care: Cross-Sectional Survey Study,"Providing patients with explanations of AI performance and factors driving prediction will require extensive study involving experts in human-centered, inclusive design working alongside AI developers, mental health care professionals, and patients.�There is a need for laboratory-based studies to understand what information regarding AI balances recognizing patient values, but also supports comprehension of important concepts and fostering appropriate trust.�These issues raise many questions for numeracy and data visualization experts regarding how information may be conveyed inclusively to patients with different needs so that the benefits of AI may be equitably realized."
417,Patient Perspectives on AI for Mental Health Care: Cross-Sectional Survey Study,"Participants in this study desired various information regarding the use of AI for their mental health care; that is, they wished to know when, for what, and why it was used; how accurate it was; and the risk factors that drove a decision. Even with highly predictive AI, patients were still not comfortable with AI that could not explain how it arrived at a result, and they qualitatively expressed concerns related to misdiagnosis and improper treatment that could result from AI use. They also reported ?understanding individual risk factors? as the most important value. It is unclear as to how much if any ?information? patient receive, and there seems to be a mismatch between the current deployment of AI for mental health care and patients? desires.�At minimum, we recommend promoting transparency in AI?s use, the communication of its accuracy, and including individual risk factors to help patients and clinicians decide when AI may be appropriate for use in health-related applications. Communications should also address how potential biases (eg, in the training data) have been evaluated and mitigated in the resultant�AI�tool."
418,Patient Perspectives on AI for Mental Health Care: Cross-Sectional Survey Study,"Future work should investigate shared regulations for AI responsibility, health professional competencies for AI use (Russell et al [62]), and interfaces that support shared decision-making when using AI."
419,Patient Perspectives on AI for Mental Health Care: Cross-Sectional Survey Study,"Implications regarding our findings are organized topically and include concrete recommendations, which have been italicized for emphasis."
420,Patient Perspectives on AI for Mental Health Care: Cross-Sectional Survey Study,"Findings in our study related to patients? values for AI for mental health care revealed challenges that AI integration may present to the patient?health professional relationship. In individual scenarios, patients overwhelmingly found mental health care professionals responsible for AI-related errors. While this does reflect similarity to the current standard of practice (ie, that health professionals are held responsible for medical errors even when computer systems are involved), future work should consider how this affects health professional well-being given the challenges related to burnout and shortages in trained mental health care workers. It also supports programs, such as AI programs falling under the US Food and Drug Administration?s purview and the European Union?s AI Act of 2023, where algorithms may be reviewed before use and subject to regulations [61]. Participants also noted that their trust in their mental health care professional would decrease if their assessment disagreed with AI. However, this was somewhat at odds with relatively fewer patients viewing issues with AI decreasing trust in their mental health care professional as ?very important.? It was also notable that approximately one-third (137/500, 27.4%) of participants said they ?did not know? how this scenario would affect their trust in their mental health care professional, which seems to highlight that patients may still be wrapping their heads around feelings regarding emerging technologies, such as AI."
421,Patient Perspectives on AI for Mental Health Care: Cross-Sectional Survey Study,"Our study provided further evidence that patients? comfort with AI varies based on what the AI does. People were the least comfortable with diagnosis delivery tasks, which lends further support to the importance of continuing to keep health professionals in the loop related to AI [35]. Similar to a previous study of pregnant people in Spain [47], patients were most comfortable with tasks that recommended general wellness strategies or talk therapy. These results also suggest that AI for tasks patients are less comfortable with may require greater care to explain and also emphasize how the AI works with the health professional."
422,Patient Perspectives on AI for Mental Health Care: Cross-Sectional Survey Study,"Just under half (245/497, 49.3%) of the respondents in our study reported that they thought AI would make mental health care better or somewhat better. This is similar to a study conducted in Germany where 53% of patients reported positive or very positive attitudes toward AI, but not specifically for mental health [46]. Participants in other studies asking perceptions regarding more specific applications of AI (eg, a radiology image interpretation study in Saudi Arabia and a pregnancy and postpartum exploration in Spain) had stronger positive attitudes toward AI [47,48]. This is consistent with qualitative studies that have found patients with specific health challenges more readily connected with AI?s potential benefits. Our study also found that women were associated with lower perceived benefits of AI for mental health, while lower self-rated health literacy and Black or African American race were each associated with more positive perceptions. The previously cited study conducted in Germany had similar findings related to lower perceived benefit among women [46]. However, it is interesting that this result remained consistent for mental health care applications, in light of the fact that women have reported lower levels of stigma regarding mental health care than men [49,50]. Our study also detected an interesting paradox that those having lower self-reported health literacy had more positive perceptions toward AI for mental health, although this finding warrants further replication and investigation. Regardless of patient perceptions, the inclusivity of patient-facing information regarding AI, ensuring those of various levels of literacy and numeracy may equitably comprehend its functions, remains critically important. Those of African American and Black race in the United States consistently report greater stigma and lower levels of trust toward mental (and other) health institutions due to biases, discrimination, and systemic racism [51,52]. The greater perceived benefit of AI for mental health care may represent a view that AI can be more just and without the biases of humans. This notion also requires further exploration, particularly given that the biases of human can often be embedded into the AI because training data embody previous human behavior."
423,Patient Perspectives on AI for Mental Health Care: Cross-Sectional Survey Study,"Respondents expressed further values and concerns beyond performance and human-AI dynamics, many of which were also covered in the closed-ended survey responses, including trust, transparency, privacy, responsibility, and cost (Table 6)."
424,Patient Perspectives on AI for Mental Health Care: Cross-Sectional Survey Study,"Table 4�provides the detailed codes, proportion of occurrence, and examples related to AI performance. Participants described issues related to AI?s accuracy, biases in AI data or biases that may occur in the use of AI, potential errors AI may commit, and how these errors may affect the quality of care. Participants expressed mixed opinions regarding whether AI would improve or degrade the quality of mental health care."
425,Patient Perspectives on AI for Mental Health Care: Cross-Sectional Survey Study,"To better understand what participants valued the most related to AI for their mental health, we asked the importance of various ethical constructs, based on MITRE?s ethical framework for consumer-generated health information [43], as they pertained to an example AI program used to support treatment for depression (Figure 3). Over 80% (range 80.2%-96%) of participants found each of the constructs somewhat or very important. Notably, the highest proportion of participants (402/500, 80.3%) viewed explainability and transparency, ?explainability,? to be very important. Participants tended to perceive decreasing the risk of negative outcomes as slightly more important than improving symptoms. Participants found AI�not�reducing trust in their mental health professional as the least important trait by comparison, although 37.2% (186/500) and 43% (215/500) rated this trait as very and somewhat important, respectively."
426,Patient Perspectives on AI for Mental Health Care: Cross-Sectional Survey Study,"Participants were more divided on who had responsibility for ensuring an AI program for mental health care was safe, with the plurality stating the company that created the program was responsible (229/500, 45.8%), followed by the mental health professional (135/500, 27%) and then the health system (73/500, 14.6%), with fewer than 10% of the participants selecting each of the remaining answer options."
427,Patient Perspectives on AI for Mental Health Care: Cross-Sectional Survey Study,"In comparing AI that was not explainable (ie, it could not describe why it made a given diagnosis), participants were generally uncomfortable even with stated AI performance accuracies of 90% (383/500, 76.6% somewhat or very uncomfortable) and 98% (289/500, 57.8% somewhat or very uncomfortable)."
428,Patient Perspectives on AI for Mental Health Care: Cross-Sectional Survey Study,"We replicated a series of questions from Khullar et al [35] assessing patient values of various aspects of AI, including transparency, explainability and performance, responsibility, and the effect of AI on trust in health professionals (Table 3)."
429,Patient Perspectives on AI for Mental Health Care: Cross-Sectional Survey Study,"Next, we asked patients their level of comfort with AI performing various tasks instead of their mental health care professional. We assessed a range of tasks (ie, assessment, diagnosis, diagnosis delivery, and treatment recommendation) and mental health issues of varied levels of perceived severity (ie, depression, bipolar disorder, and suicide), as shown in�Figure 2. Participants were the most comfortable (reporting being very or somewhat comfortable) with recommendations of nonpharmacological interventions, including general wellness management strategies (357/500, 71.4%) and talk therapy (328/500, 65.6%). Participants expressed moderate comfort with AI performing a mental health care assessment but were less comfortable (with only 20% to 32% selecting very or somewhat comfortable) with various prediction, diagnosis, and diagnosis delivery tasks, as well as a medication recommendation task. Participants were the least comfortable with diagnosis delivery tasks (ie, telling someone directly they have a mental health condition), including for clinical depression (123/500, 24.6%) and bipolar disorder (103/500, 20.6%)."
430,Patient Perspectives on AI for Mental Health Care: Cross-Sectional Survey Study,"Participants were first asked, ?Overall, in the next 5 years, do you think AI will make mental health care in the United States...? Answer options included ?much better,? ?somewhat better,? ?minimal change,? ?somewhat worse,? ?much worse,? and ?don?t know.? We computed a logistic regression model such that ?much better? and ?somewhat better? were classified as 1, and the other responses were classified as 0, excluding the 3 (0.6) participants, among the total 500 participants, answering, ?don?t know.? Among 497 included respondents, 245 (49.3%) respondents believed that AI would make mental health care better or much better.�Table 2�reveals that participants of Black or African American race (P=.04; odds ratio [OR] 1.76, 95% CI 1.03-3.05) and those with lower health literacy (P=.004; OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.29-3.78) were significantly more likely to endorse that AI would make mental health care somewhat or much better. Women, by contrast, were significantly less likely to endorse this statement (P=.046; OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.46-0.99)."
431,Patient Perspectives on AI for Mental Health Care: Cross-Sectional Survey Study,"The first level of analysis involved assessing descriptive statistics to understand trends in participant perceptions and values. We also selected an outcome of interest (perceived benefit of AI for mental health) and created a logistic regression model to better understand whether perceived benefits may differ by sociodemographic factors, specifically age, gender, race, education, financial resources, mental health history, and self-rated health literacy [40]. The � value for all analyses was set at .05, and the R software (version 4.2.1; The R Foundation) was used. An analysis of a subset of this data (only those of participants reporting female sex at birth) related to differences in perspectives based on pregnancy history has been reported in a separate manuscript [41]."
432,Patient Perspectives on AI for Mental Health Care: Cross-Sectional Survey Study,"All participants were recruited from Prolific?s survey sampling panel and were verified users who agreed to participate in research studies via the Prolific website. Our sample included those aged �18 years, residing in the United States, and with the ability to speak and read English. We recruited a sample representative of the adult US population in terms of age, race, and gender, according to the US Census. We initially recruited 530 survey respondents, of whom 30 (5.7%) did not begin the survey after reading the informed consent document, resulting in a total of 500 (94.3%) respondents. All 500 respondents finished the survey (0 incomplete responses) over a median time of 15 minutes and 24 seconds."
433,Patient Perspectives on AI for Mental Health Care: Cross-Sectional Survey Study,"Finally, following the sections regarding concerns and values, the survey contained open-ended questions to allow people to provide free-text responses with additional concerns or values."
434,Patient Perspectives on AI for Mental Health Care: Cross-Sectional Survey Study,"We also extended the questionnaire to understand participant?s values pertaining to AI design and implementation for mental health care to facilitate a more patient-centered design of future AI applications for mental health. This section asked patients to rate their level of importance regarding various statements pertaining to AI for mental health care, as informed by the constructs of MITRE?s bioethical framework.�Multimedia Appendix 1�displays the value statements presented to participants based on the relevant bioethics constructs."
435,Patient Perspectives on AI for Mental Health Care: Cross-Sectional Survey Study,"This study was approved by the BRANY Institutional Review Board (protocol 22-01024358).

438,Patient Perspectives on AI for Mental Health Care: Cross-Sectional Survey Study,RQ 1: Do the public perceive AI to be beneficial for mental health care? RQ 1 Equity: Do perceived benefits differ by sociodemographic factors?
439,Patient Perspectives on AI for Mental Health Care: Cross-Sectional Survey Study,"To address the deficit in knowledge regarding patient perspectives on AI, Khullar et al [35] conducted a survey of a nationally representative panel of the US-based population. While most respondents reported a perceived benefit of using AI in health care, comfort with AI unsurprisingly varied based on the accuracy, transparency, and clinical application of AI (eg, reading a chest x-ray vs making a cancer diagnosis) [35]. The survey conducted by Khullar et al [35] focused on somatic applications of AI, leaving questions regarding public perceptions of AI for mental health care applications unanswered. However, others have explored narrower issues related to feedback on specific mental health care apps and specific prediction tasks (eg, the prediction of suicide) [36,37]."
440,Patient Perspectives on AI for Mental Health Care: Cross-Sectional Survey Study,"AI has already made significant strides in the field of medical imaging, aiding health professionals at various stages, including improving image quality [5], guiding image acquisition [6], risk-stratifying images to be reviewed by a specialist (ie, a radiologist) [7,8], and interpreting images [9,10]. More recently, predictive AI has been leveraged to detect mental health?related issues, including major depressive disorders [11,12], stress, anxiety [13], bipolar disorder [14], and even suicide [15,16]. AI has also commonly been used for treatment selection in fields such as oncology and mental health [17,18]. Despite the demonstrated predictive accuracy of AI, relatively few of the predictive AI tools created are implemented in everyday clinical care [19], and even fewer tools have demonstrated a positive clinical impact compared to current standards of care [20-22]. Furthermore, of the 89 unique articles in 2 systematic reviews of clinical trials evaluating predictive AI, none focused on mental health?related conditions [20,21]."
441,Patient Perspectives on AI for Mental Health Care: Cross-Sectional Survey Study,"Future work involving the use of AI for mental health care should investigate strategies for conveying the level of AI?s accuracy, factors that drive patients? mental health risks, and how data are used confidentially so that patients can determine with their health professionals when AI may be beneficial. It will also be important in a mental health care context to ensure the patient?health professional relationship is preserved when AI is used."
442,Patient Perspectives on AI for Mental Health Care: Cross-Sectional Survey Study,"We conducted a 1-time cross-sectional survey with a nationally representative sample of 500 US-based adults. Participants provided structured responses on their perceived benefits, concerns, comfort, and values regarding AI for mental health care. They could also add free-text responses to elaborate on their concerns and values."
443,Patient Perspectives on AI for Mental Health Care: Cross-Sectional Survey Study,"The application of artificial intelligence (AI) to health and health care is rapidly increasing. Several studies have assessed the attitudes of health professionals, but far fewer studies have explored the perspectives of patients or the general public. Studies investigating patient perspectives have focused on somatic issues, including those related to radiology, perinatal health, and general applications. Patient feedback has been elicited in the development of specific mental health care solutions, but broader perspectives toward AI for mental health care have been underexplored."
444,Machine Learning Techniques to Predict Mental Health Diagnoses: A Systematic Literature Review,"Supervised learning methods, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), as well as deep learning algorithms such as Neural Network (NN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), have demonstrated effectiveness in forecasting mental health disorders. Certain algorithms stood out using the author's dataset for each specific disease. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in bipolar disorder demonstrated outstanding performance, achieving an impressive accuracy rate and f-measure of 99.75%, surpassing other models. In the case of schizophrenia, SVM attained 90% for f-measure and 95% for AUC. For PTSD, both CNN and RF achieved a notable accuracy rate of 99%. In ADHD, ELM outperformed other algorithms with an AUC of 0.8757%. Lastly, neural networks showed the highest accuracy and AUC metrics of 99.03% for depression and anxiety."
445,Machine Learning Techniques to Predict Mental Health Diagnoses: A Systematic Literature Review,"In summary, this review sheds light on the potential of machine learning in detecting mental health disorders, such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, PTSD, depression, and anxiety. The use of machine learning models presents avenues for early detection and personalized interventions, promising to enhance patient outcomes. Nevertheless, researchers must acknowledge the limitations within these studies, including small sample sizes, diverse datasets, and ethical considerations. Addressing these challenges is crucial for further validation and the eventual implementation of machine-learning approaches in mental health diagnostics (Table�S1�(194.2KB, pdf)�)."
446,Machine Learning Techniques to Predict Mental Health Diagnoses: A Systematic Literature Review,"In the case of PTSD, diverse approaches using physiological signals, textual features, EEG signals, and social media data have shown the potential of machine learning in detection. Costa�et al. [30] utilized physiological signals, Banerjee�et al. [65] focused on textual features, and Coppersmith�et al., Beymohammadi�et al.,�and Miotto�et al. [67-69] analyzed EEG signals by employing natural language processing and deep learning models, respectively, on various data sources, revealing the versatility of machine learning in assisting with PTSD detection."
447,Machine Learning Techniques to Predict Mental Health Diagnoses: A Systematic Literature Review,"Liu�et al. and Johnson�et al. [4,�5] employed natural language processing to anticipate bipolar disorder using textual data and demonstrated the potential of neuroimaging data in differentiating bipolar disorder patients from healthy controls. For instance, in the context of mental health disorders, studies conducted by L�pez Steinmetz�et al. and Joshi�et al. [45,�46] highlight the extensive assessment of the COVID-19 mental health implications among Argentine college students, as well as the creative application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms for diagnosing depression and emotional states. Birner�et al. [55] proposed that because of the variety of symptoms associated with bipolar disorder, correctly diagnosing bipolar disorder can take over nine years. Individuals with bipolar illness may benefit from early detection and care, which might dramatically enhance their quality of life and lifespan. The hypothesis is that machine learning approaches can help with the diagnostic process, potentially lowering misdiagnosis rates."
448,Machine Learning Techniques to Predict Mental Health Diagnoses: A Systematic Literature Review,"The increasing prevalence of mental health disorders, coupled with the advancement of technology, has led to a growing interest in utilizing machine learning techniques for early detection and diagnosis. In recent years, the potential of machine learning in detecting a range of mental health disorders, including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, PTSD, depression, and anxiety, has gained significant attention. These disorders pose a substantial challenge to mental healthcare due to their complex nature and the limitations of traditional diagnostic methods."
449,Machine Learning Techniques to Predict Mental Health Diagnoses: A Systematic Literature Review,"Watts�et al. [74] utilized algorithms like Random Forests and SVM on EEG data to predict major depressive disorder (MDD) diagnosis.

450,Machine Learning Techniques to Predict Mental Health Diagnoses: A Systematic Literature Review,"Various machine learning techniques have been explored for detecting Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), leveraging diverse datasets and methodologies. Costa�et al. proposed Support Vector Machines (SVM) using physiological signals [64], while Banerjee�et al. focused on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks with textual features [65]. He�et al. combined Random Forest, AdaBoost, and SVM with demographic and behavioral features [66]. Lekkas�et al. explored the use of GPS data from smartphones to detect PTSD diagnostic status among previously traumatized women, achieving high predictive performance with an AUC of 0.816, balanced sensitivity of 0.743, balanced specificity of 0.8, and balanced accuracy of 0.771, suggesting the potential utility of GPS information as a digital biomarker for PTSD [67], Beymohammadi�et al. used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with EEG signals [68], and Miotto�et al. utilized Deep Learning models with electronic health records [69]. Jeffrey�et al. employed machine learning on social media data for PTSD signs [70]. These studies collectively illustrate diverse methodologies and data sources, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of PTSD detection. Despite limitations, this body of research highlights the potential of machine learning in aiding PTSD detection and advancing treatment strategies."
451,Machine Learning Techniques to Predict Mental Health Diagnoses: A Systematic Literature Review,"Several studies have showcased the effectiveness of machine learning (ML) techniques in predicting schizophrenia. While Bohaterewicz�et al. concentrated on leveraging machine learning and advanced neuroimaging to improve prediction of suicide risk in schizophrenic patients [38], Kirchebner�et al. employed Boosted Classification Trees to explore the factors influencing violent behavior in the same population [39]. This dual approach highlights the potential of machine learning for both improving risk prediction of suicide and identifying factors associated with violence in schizophrenia, paving the way for better patient outcomes and targeted interventions. Hahn�et al. achieved an impressive 84% accuracy using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and diffusion tensor imaging data [59]. Building on prior research, Hettige�et al. and Birnbaum�et al. explored machine learning for mental health diagnosis using different algorithms, like SVM, LR, RF,�etc�[60,�61]. Notably, Birnbaum�et al. performed better in identifying schizophrenia�via�social media analysis [61].

456,Machine Learning Techniques to Predict Mental Health Diagnoses: A Systematic Literature Review,"Depression prevalence is highest in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, with females more affected than males. Untreated depression can lead to suicidal thoughts [32]. Anxiety, defined by the APA, involves tension, worry, and physical symptoms like increased heart rate and muscle tension [33]. It arises from perceived threats or stressors, real or imagined."
457,Machine Learning Techniques to Predict Mental Health Diagnoses: A Systematic Literature Review,"The DSM-5 [21] delineates diagnostic criteria for PTSD, requiring exposure to potentially life-threatening events accompanied by specific symptoms persisting for at least a month, causing distress or impairment. Risk-taking behaviors encompass actions with uncertain outcomes, such as substance abuse, delinquency, poor health, unhealthy eating, and unprotected sex [22-24]. Studies highlight a correlation between exposure to trauma, the development of PTSD, and subsequent engagement in risk-taking behaviors [25-28]. Childhood maltreatment predicts higher levels of risky behavior in adolescence and adulthood, with sexual abuse being a significant factor [29]. These findings underscore the interplay between traumatic experiences, mental health, and behavioral outcomes."
458,Machine Learning Techniques to Predict Mental Health Diagnoses: A Systematic Literature Review,"Schizophrenia, a multidimensional mental health illness, presents long-term issues for both people and families. It usually appears early in childhood and causes symptoms, such as skewed beliefs, sensory experiences disconnected from reality, and issues with cognitive functioning [18-20].

463,Machine Learning Techniques to Predict Mental Health Diagnoses: A Systematic Literature Review,"Despite the success of machine learning algorithms, there is a lack of explicit justification by many researchers for their chosen ML methods, raising concerns about potential oversights in leveraging algorithmic strengths for specific mental health analysis tasks [1]. Additionally, a worrisome trend of applying ML algorithms without a thorough understanding of the underlying data characteristics has been noted, compromising the reliability and generalizability of study findings. This emphasizes the critical need for researchers to consider the compatibility between the selected ML algorithm and the nuances of the mental health data under investigation."

466,Machine Learning Techniques to Predict Mental Health Diagnoses: A Systematic Literature Review,"Machine learning techniques, which fulfill the purposes of data analysis, prediction, and deriving meaning from data, have become invaluable for predicting mental health. Two main types of ML, namely supervised learning and unsupervised learning, are commonly employed in mental health research [1]. Supervised learning, utilizing structured training data, is extensively used in medical research, while the application of unsupervised learning in clinical settings is limited [2]. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is not covered in this paper due to its limited relevance to mental health data, as it focuses on agents learning optimal behaviors in interactive environments."
467,Machine Learning Techniques to Predict Mental Health Diagnoses: A Systematic Literature Review,"This study offers valuable insights into the potential and challenges of machine learning in predicting mental health conditions among college students. While deep learning models like CNN show promise, addressing data limitations and incorporating temporal dynamics are crucial for further advancements."

Papers published between January, 2011, and May, 2024, specifically focusing on deep learning models for mental health diagnoses, were considered. The selection process adhered to PRISMA guidelines and resulted in 30 relevant studies."
469,Ethical trade-offs in AI for mental health,ML algorithms are showing promising results for prediction of psychiatric conditions. In this article I have argued that psychiatrists should be wary of claims that ML algorithms are objective in the sense of not being influenced by human values and biases. At several stages in the development of a predictive algorithm decisions must be made which will reflect value judgments.
470,Ethical trade-offs in AI for mental health,3. Hence the probability that this patient suffers MDD = n.
471,Ethical trade-offs in AI for mental health,1. The proportion of patients with features X who suffer MDD�= n.
472,Ethical trade-offs in AI for mental health,"An algorithm to be used in clinical practice must convey information to its user. Focusing on cases of prediction and diagnosis, the assumption has been that an MDD prediction algorithm would provide the user with a binary output: positive or negative for MDD. However, it is by no means obvious that this is the proper way to present the output of the algorithm to the user. To begin with, a binary classification of patients will be based on a predetermined threshold such that patients whose risk score is at or above the threshold will be classified as positive for MDD and those scoring below the threshold are classified as negative. However, the information provided by the algorithm could also be the risk score of the patient. This would leave more room for the user to decide whether to classify the patient as MDD."
473,Ethical trade-offs in AI for mental health,"The black box nature of ML algorithms reflects their central strength. The complexity of the algorithm is not limited by human capacities for finding predictive patterns in a dataset and manually transforming the pattern into a mathematical model. The flipside is that ML models go beyond what humans can comprehend and explain. An alternative to ML algorithms is algorithms which are interpretable. Such models are simpler and perhaps less accurate. However, they have the advantage of being such that humans can understand and explain how they arrive at a prediction based on an input. A linear function with one or two predictive variables may not be as accurate as a complex deep neural network but it is easy for humans to grasp how the values of the input variables produce the prediction."
474,Ethical trade-offs in AI for mental health,"What transpires is that when designing an algorithm for MDD prediction, its performance will tend to differ with respect to protected groups such as groups defined by gender or race. However, how it differs is a design choice. If one decides to set up the algorithm to produce equal error rates for men and women one also accepts that there will be men and women who will not receive the same prediction despite the fact that they are estimated to be equally likely to suffer MDD. Alternatively, one can decide to apply the same threshold for when the algorithm should make a positive prediction of MDD for all individuals. However, in that case one also accepts that error rates might be very different for protected groups. The disparity in error rates will in turn affect the burdens imposed on these groups from erroneous predictions. Thus, the design of an algorithm will reflect a decision about the appropriate distribution of prediction errors across groups.�1"
475,Ethical trade-offs in AI for mental health,"In relation to our focus on the prediction and diagnosis of mental disorders a key issue concerns how to fairly distribute prediction errors across salient groups such as protected groups referred to in relation to discrimination legislation. The issue became top of the agenda when an algorithm for predicting recidivism widely used in the criminal justice system in the United States was criticized for being biased against Black defendants (18). The problem identified by Angwin et�al. (18) was that COMPAS, as the algorithm is called, seemed to have very different error rates for Black and White defendants. Thus, it was twice as likely to falsely flag a Black defendant as high risk of re-offending if released before trial as compared to a white defendant. And it was twice as likely to falsely flag a White defendant as low risk of re-offending if released before trial as compared to a Black defendant."
476,Ethical trade-offs in AI for mental health,"In addition to considerations about representativeness such as those just described, another important decision concerns whether the data to be used are structured. In case they are, there is a question about which categories should be included. For example, there has been some debate about whether protected categories such as race and gender should be made available for the algorithm during training, as well as whether gender should be given a binary categorization. Again, I do not claim that there is a single correct way to construct a dataset. My point is that a dataset, the way the world is represented to the algorithm, is a construction based on several value-laden decisions concerning what in the present context makes for a good dataset."
477,Ethical trade-offs in AI for mental health,"To illustrate this, consider a team of algorithm developers with a fixed budget who must decide on how to construct their training dataset (15). How should they spend the data budget? Assuming that the real-world population consists of 50 percent men and 50 percent women, should they aim for a dataset that has equal representation of men and women? Perhaps it is more expensive for them to acquire depression diagnosis data about men. Thus, ensuring equal representation will result in a smaller dataset than allowing for a larger proportion of women."
478,Ethical trade-offs in AI for mental health,"To illustrate, there might be agreement that it is important to improve diagnostic accuracy of MDD in primary care. One way to do so is to develop and implement algorithmic prediction tools. However, there are other ways in which this goal could be achieved. One alternative could be to invest in better education and training of general practitioners, or in providing them with better feedback on the diagnoses they make enabling them to learn from their past diagnoses. And if the problem to be solved is that men are underdiagnosed with MDD, an alternative way of handling the problem could be to improve physicians? awareness of possible biases in diagnostic reasoning about male patients. In either case, the decision to invest in development and implementation of algorithmic MDD prediction is in effect to suggest that it is a better solution to a problem than alternatives. And as such the choice can be described as reflecting an ethical tradeoff: Assuming one cannot do both, it is better to invest in developing and implementing an algorithm than in better and targeted education of general practitioners."
479,Ethical trade-offs in AI for mental health,"In our case of MDD prediction, there are many different goals that one might seek to achieve by introducing algorithmic MDD prediction in primary care. One might have as a goal to improve diagnostic accuracy. Or to achieve the same level of accuracy for less money. Other aims could be to address problems of over- and underdiagnosis or to address biases against certain patient groups among diagnosticians."
480,Ethical trade-offs in AI for mental health,"Generally, the traditional methods of diagnosis rely heavily on interviews and questionnaires. There are several reasons why it might be attractive for patients and practitioners alike to welcome algorithmic diagnostic support. First, the traditional methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Moreover, their accuracy is highly dependent on the practitioner?s personal experience including not only years of experience but also the variety of patients to which the practitioner has been exposed in the past. Obviously younger practitioners must rely on less experience than more seasoned ones. In addition, practitioners will likely be influenced by some form of bias regardless of their experience and genuine attempt to rely only on relevant information. Finally, patients will also display personal differences when it comes to their ability and willingness to reveal information, e.g., due to fears of stigmatization. An algorithm applied, e.g., across the country may improve on this situation by providing more uniform assessments of patients based on empirically established patterns in much larger and more varied dataset than any individual practitioner can acquire and analyze on their own. In turn this may not only improve accuracy but also prevent the practitioner from missing out on relevant symptoms."
481,Ethical trade-offs in AI for mental health,"There is a plethora of AI tools which may enter clinical practice. However, for the purpose of this analysis, I will focus on the prediction and diagnosis of mental disorders. I illustrate the considerations in relation to a hypothetical case of the development and use of an algorithm for predicting major depressive disorder (MDD) in primary care. Such use does not seem wholly unrealistic. Depression is a frequent and costly condition, and in most cases the initial diagnosis is made by general practitioners. However, as with other psychiatric disorders, you cannot just take a blood test and get a reliable determination of whether the condition is present. MDD comes in many guises and degrees making its diagnosis a complex and challenging affair, in particular in primary care, where physicians? diagnostic accuracy tends to be low with general practitioners failing to make correct diagnosis in about 50 percent of cases (13)."
482,Ethical trade-offs in AI for mental health,"This article aims to highlight several ways in which algorithms incorporate choices and assumptions that reflect ethical trade-offs - notions of what is good and bad, right and wrong, fair and unfair. That is not to say that using algorithms might not improve on current methods of clinical psychiatry. There are aspects of algorithmic predictions which may indeed be thought to make predictions more accurate, uniform, reliable, and less prone to human biases. However, it is important also to explicate how predictive algorithms for psychiatry will be shaped by judgments that, perhaps unreflectively, invoke ethical values and trade-offs."
483,Ethical trade-offs in AI for mental health,"A central argument for deploying algorithmic methods in clinical decision-making in psychiatry is that they may ?enhance the speed, accuracy and objectivity? of clinical decisions (7, 172). Thus, using ?objective and automated methods? for clinical decisions in psychiatry (11, 2) is expected to improve the highly subjective nature of decision-making in psychiatry, which in large part relies on the clinician-patient communication."
484,Ethical trade-offs in AI for mental health,"AI is coming to psychiatry. The expectation is that machine learning (ML) algorithms will help improve diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment (1). Such algorithms have already shown expert-level accuracy in detecting medical conditions such as eye diseases (2), kinds of cancer (3), and pulmonary conditions (4) to mention a few. ML algorithms can also provide accurate estimates of the probability that a patient has an outcome of interest for mental health, e.g. of whether the patient will transition to psychosis (5). The average accuracy of ML algorithms in psychiatry has been estimated to be around 80 percent and improving (6). This level of accuracy would seem to be a boon to psychiatry which struggles with low predictive accuracy (7). Moreover, the development of algorithms focusing on mental health and psychiatric disorders is accelerating. For example, the yearly number of publications of algorithms for predicting depression more than doubled from 2013?2017 (6)."
485,Brain Disorder Detection and Diagnosis using Machine Learning and Deep Learning - A Bibliometric Analysis,"The most common brain disorder data modalities are MRI and EEG. Some researchers also highlighted the application of fMRI for the automated identification of brain diseases. Also, ML and DL applications mostly targeted Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, autism, epilepsy, and schizophrenia. Our study also points towards potential directions for future research including explainability of models, data privacy issues, and human-AI interactions in the clinic for diagnostic decision-making. In conclusion, our study documents growing interested and productivity in this field, which may continue to grow exponentially until many limitations are sorted out and ML/DL-based diagnosis of brain disorders becomes robust enough for adoption in clinical practice."

Future research might compile data from numerous digital libraries, such as PubMed, and Web of Science, into a single dataset. As a result, the target dataset for the study would be significantly bigger, allowing for a far broader examination. When collecting datasets from Scopus, we used 8.5 years as a constraint in the search circumstances. A considerably greater range of study findings might be discovered by looking over 10 years of publishing. Finally, non-English materials were not removed or chosen, which aided the automatic bibliometric analysis. However, a linguistic bias might have occurred. Non-English publications might be translated by language translators, allowing them to be included in the dataset as well."
488,Brain Disorder Detection and Diagnosis using Machine Learning and Deep Learning - A Bibliometric Analysis,"We reported the findings of our bibliometric investigation in the preceding sections. In this part, we will provide possible directions for further study based on our findings. These are intended to serve as a starting point for interested academics. It is critical to examine how the interplay of ML, DL, and humans may or should appear in the context of brain disorder detection and diagnosis. Future studies should look at which type of collaboration between ML, DL, and humans [75] is most suited for brain disorder detection and diagnosis. This raises the question of whether an ML and DL-based system in place of a physician for brain tumor detection and diagnosis is even possible or not. ML and DL have the potential to help with the case of brain disorder detection and diagnosis, improve brain MRI scanning and segmentation, support decision-making, and anticipate disease risk. As a result, ML and DL in brain disorder detection and diagnosis are utilized to aid medical scientists, lab personnel, and researchers in the health care business. ML and DL in brain disorder detection and diagnosis assist doctors in providing disease analysis and guiding them in treating a specific ailment more effectively. As a result, doctors' medical judgments may be made more prudently, and standards are increasing. Furthermore, trust between the ML and DL-based brain disorder detection and diagnostic model and the humans involved is critical. Although ML and DL algorithms frequently outperform human experts in terms of accuracy [76], there is a lack of trust in the predictions provided by these systems. It should thus be examined why there is a lack of confidence and how trust in ML and DL-based systems may be increased. This is also true for patients who may be subjected to therapies based mostly on the outcomes of these systems."
489,Brain Disorder Detection and Diagnosis using Machine Learning and Deep Learning - A Bibliometric Analysis,"The results of our bibliometric research demonstrate that the most renowned publications are from a small number of authors. Because the bulk of publications are open access, contributions are promptly shared with the public, and a huge number of authors develop as the field advances. It is also worth noting that papers in the field are being increasingly referenced (with 522 citations for the most cited work), demonstrating how relevant it is right now. The USA, India, and China are the top three countries in terms of research production in this sector. These findings are not surprising considering that these countries' top Nation Rank's rankings for global scientific production across all categories. The findings reveal that even the most prolific researchers employ a diversity of methodologies and skills, confirming the field?s interdisciplinarity.

Cluster 5 (orange) and cluster 6 (brown) include only one keyword ?machine learning (ml)? and ?magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)? respectively. These findings reflect the extensive usage of ML and DL for brain disorder detection and diagnosis and their application to psychiatry using MRI (cluster 1), specific application to Autism (cluster 3) possibly driven by the early availability of a large public database of fMRI data from Autistic subjects in the form of ABIDE database, the application of Parkinson?s and the widespread clinical use of deep brain stimulation for Parkinson?s (cluster 4) and the generic use of EEG and MRI data to drive ML and DL algorithms for brain diagnosis (rest of the clusters).

533,Brain Disorder Detection and Diagnosis using Machine Learning and Deep Learning - A Bibliometric Analysis,Bibliometric analysis techniques are emerging techniques nowadays as it provides the trend and importance of a particular research field. In thus study two tools Bibliometrix/Bilioshiny [18] and VOSviewer [19] are used for the analysis as discussed in the introduction section.
534,Brain Disorder Detection and Diagnosis using Machine Learning and Deep Learning - A Bibliometric Analysis,"The initial step was to gather bibliometric information for our investigation. Several databases exist now for the collection of bibliometric data, with Scopus and Web of Science being among the most popular. The characteristics and functionality of these databases differ and thus we collected the bibliometric data from only the Scopus [23] database. The main motivation for selecting the Scopus database is as follows. This database includes more journals than Web of Science and was thus deemed to be appropriate for identifying as many research articles as feasible. Although additional databases such as Google Scholar and PubMed are available, we choose not to use them [24]. First, unlike Google Scholar, Scopus allows researchers to create a comprehensive search phrase and instantly obtain all bibliometric metadata. Second, Scopus covers far more multidisciplinary research than PubMed. Thus, we identified Scopus to be the best database for conducting a bibliometric study since ML and DL-based brain disorder detection and diagnosis is a multidisciplinary research field."

542,Brain Disorder Detection and Diagnosis using Machine Learning and Deep Learning - A Bibliometric Analysis,"Brain disorder diagnosis is a growing and challenging issue due to the large volumes of brain disorder data generated by current diagnostic tools. Manual analysis of this data is often subjective, leading to the development of automated computer-aided diagnosis systems using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) technology [6-8]. These systems have become an important research topic in recent years, as medical data collection techniques and ML approaches may vary depending on the diagnostic method and disorder type. The field has seen explosive growth in recent years, making it difficult to understand the path charted due to the large and diverse literature. A systematic bibliometric study of the field is needed to assess trends, future research subjects, state-of-the-art, and breakthroughs in brain disorder detection and diagnosis using ML and DL techniques."
543,Brain Disorder Detection and Diagnosis using Machine Learning and Deep Learning - A Bibliometric Analysis,"Despite advances in medical technology and care, diagnoses of brain disorders (especially psychiatric disorders) remain a challenge due to our limited understanding of brain function. The brain is often regarded as the most essential organ in the human body, governing ideas, memories, emotions, motor abilities, vision, and respiration. The human brain is made up of 100 billion neurons that are linked together by more than 100 trillion synapses [3]. These connections are organized at different spatial scales anatomically, and interact with one another at different temporal scales functionally. Because of this complexity, understanding the neurological underpinnings of brain functions remains a challenge."
544,Brain Disorder Detection and Diagnosis using Machine Learning and Deep Learning - A Bibliometric Analysis,"In summary, our quantitative bibliometric analysis provides useful insights about trends in the field and points them to potential directions in applying machine learning and deep learning for brain disorder detection and diagnosis."
545,Brain Disorder Detection and Diagnosis using Machine Learning and Deep Learning - A Bibliometric Analysis,We carried out a bibliometric analysis to create an overview of brain disorder detection and diagnosis using machine learning and deep learning.

546,"An artificial intelligence tool to assess the risk of severe mental distress among college students in terms of demographics, eating habits, lifestyles, and sport habits: an externally validated study using machine learning","In conclusion, the developed AI tool demonstrates promising predictive performance for identifying college students at risk of severe mental distress. Its high accuracy and reliability highlight its potential to guide intervention strategies and support early identification and preventive measures. The tool?s accessibility and ability to provide personalized recommendations make it a valuable resource for improving mental health outcomes among college students."
547,"An artificial intelligence tool to assess the risk of severe mental distress among college students in terms of demographics, eating habits, lifestyles, and sport habits: an externally validated study using machine learning","University students identified as low-risk individuals in terms of severe anxiety and depression require a different approach to management. While their mental health concerns may be less severe, proactive measures should still be taken to promote their overall well-being and prevent the development of more significant issues. One key aspect is the provision of mental health education and exercise or mindfulness-based programs on campus [35,�36]. These initiatives can help students recognize the signs of mental distress and equip them with self-help strategies to manage mental distress and maintain good mental health. Additionally, establishing a supportive environment through peer support groups or mentoring programs can foster a sense of belonging and provide a platform for students to share their experiences and seek guidance [37]. By implementing these preventive measures, the university can create a nurturing environment that supports the mental well-being of all students, including those at low risk for severe mental distress. It is crucial to acknowledge that although the AI application offers risk estimates and recommendations, clinical decision-making should encompass the expertise of healthcare providers and take into account the unique context of each student. Notably, a comprehensive support mechanism was implemented during the study. This included providing participants with access to mental health professionals, offering counseling services, and ensuring that participants were informed about these resources prior to their involvement. Besides, this study established a clear protocol for managing distress during and after participation, ensuring participants had immediate support if needed."
548,"An artificial intelligence tool to assess the risk of severe mental distress among college students in terms of demographics, eating habits, lifestyles, and sport habits: an externally validated study using machine learning","Machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques have been utilized for early detection, prognostication, and prediction of negative psychological well-being states [7?9]. For instance, Rahman et al. [7] discovered that machine learning algorithms can effectively assess mental well-being, with random forest and adaptive boosting algorithms achieving the highest accuracy in identifying negative mental well-being traits. The key predictors of poor mental well-being included the frequency of sports activities per week, body mass index, grade point average, sedentary hours, and age. The study proposes that these findings could be utilized to offer cost-effective support and enhance mental well-being assessment and monitoring at both the individual and university levels. Baba et al. [8] developed a machine learning model to predict students? mental health problems using health survey data and response time metrics. The LightGBM model was found to be the most effective, with high predictive performance (AUC?=?0.857). Responses to questions about campus life were key predictors of mental health issues based on the SHAP analysis. While the inclusion of response time-related variables did not significantly improve predictions, certain derived variables based on response times enhanced prediction accuracy. The findings suggest the potential of using machine learning to predict mental health issues over time and highlight the importance of incorporating behavioral data in mental health assessments. Meda et al. [9] focused on the mental health of university students, revealing high levels of severe depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. Economic worry was associated with depression, and demographic factors were found to be poor predictors of mental health outcomes. The random forest algorithm showed high accuracy in predicting students maintaining well-being (Accuracy: 0.85) but had limitations in predicting symptom worsening (Accuracy: 0.49). Anbarasi et al. [14] used the RF to established a model to assess quality of life, and the study found a positive correlation between sleep quality and anxiety levels. Students were identified as being highly susceptible to mental health disturbances during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly due to factors such as online learning challenges, parental involvement, and workload stress. In the present study, we also found that quality of sleep was an important contributor to severe mental distress, as it ranked first based on feature importance analysis. Ratul et al. [15] developed a reliable machine learning-based prediction model using the multilayer perceptron algorithm for perceived stress and achieved high accuracy (Accuracy: 0.805), precision, F1 score, and recall values. However, the convenience sampling technique used in the study may have biased results and lack generalizability. In addition, Rois et al. [16] used advanced machine learning approaches to predict the prevalence of stress among Bangladeshi university students (n?=?355), and identified important risk factors for stress, including pulse rate, blood pressure, sleep and smoking status, and academic background. The RF model showed the highest performance in predicting stress (AUC: 0.897), outperforming logistic regression and support vector machine models. The outcome indicator of our study was severe mental distress, while the outcome indicators in the above other studies included negative mental well-being traits, mental health problems, severe depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and perceived stress. Although the model variables differ, they generally cover similar aspects such as exercise habits and sleep habits. In addition, by comparing, it can be seen that although these studies all utilize machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to predict and assess the mental health status of college students, their research content and focus are different, exploring and studying different aspects of mental health issues."
549,"An artificial intelligence tool to assess the risk of severe mental distress among college students in terms of demographics, eating habits, lifestyles, and sport habits: an externally validated study using machine learning","The web-based AI tool has been successfully developed by uploading the highly optimized eXGBM model and its code to a GitHub repository.

558,"An artificial intelligence tool to assess the risk of severe mental distress among college students in terms of demographics, eating habits, lifestyles, and sport habits: an externally validated study using machine learning","To assess the prediction performance of our models, we employed highly recognized and commonly used metrics. These metrics included the AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1 score, Brier score, log loss, discrimination slope, calibration slope, and intercept [28,�29]. The AUC was calculated by applying 100 bootstraps and represents the overall performance of a model, as it measures the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. A higher AUC indicates a better discrimination ability of the model, and a value above 0.90 is typically indicative of excellent prediction performance. Accuracy, precision, recall, and specificity were evaluated using confusion matrix [29]. Accuracy is a fundamental metric that quantifies the ability of a classification model to correctly classify instances. It was calculated by dividing the number of correctly classified instances (true positives and true negatives) by the total number of instances. Precision, on the other hand, focuses on the proportion of instances that were accurately predicted as positive out of all instances predicted as positive. It was calculated by dividing the number of true positive predictions by the sum of true positive and false positive predictions. Recall, also known as sensitivity or the true positive rate, measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all actual positive instances. It was calculated by dividing the number of true positive predictions by the sum of true positive and false negative predictions."
559,"An artificial intelligence tool to assess the risk of severe mental distress among college students in terms of demographics, eating habits, lifestyles, and sport habits: an externally validated study using machine learning","In order to ensure the smooth development and validation of machine learning-based models, a comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline was employed in this study. The pipeline utilized the scikit-learn library (version 1.1.3) to achieve data standardization. Additionally, to address the challenge of imbalanced data distribution and improve the robustness of our models, we employed the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique in conjunction with Tomek Links Undersampling Techniques [11?13,�25,�26]. This resampling technique, known as SMOTETomek, effectively balanced the proportions of outcome classes within the training and validation groups. The SMOTETomek was selected to address data imbalance because it combines SMOTE, which generates synthetic minority class samples, and Tomek Links, which remove borderline or noisy instances, resulting in a balanced and cleaner dataset. This approach reduces overfitting by eliminating overlapping instances, enhances class separability, and is particularly effective in complex datasets where the minority class is dispersed. In addition, by implementing a stratified strategy, we ensured consistency in these proportions."

The PSQI consists of 19 items that evaluate factors such as sleep duration, disturbances, latency, efficiency, medication usage, and daytime dysfunction. Each item is scored on a scale from 0 to 3, with a total score ranging from 0 to 21. Higher scores indicate poorer overall sleep quality. The Chinese version of PSQI has been pre-validated in Chinese university students [20]."

The college years are a critical period when young adults face various challenges and transitions that can significantly impact their mental health. Studies have shown that college students experience high rates of mental distress, including anxiety, depression, and other psychological disorders [1], and there was a notable rise in self-reported psychological distress. Severe mental distress, including severe anxiety or depression [4], has been linked to several negative outcomes such as poor academic performance, decreased social engagement, and an increased risk of substance abuse [5,�6]."

565,"War, emotions, mental health, and artificial intelligence","Emotionally based strategic communications supported by ChatGPT and Gemini have the potential to revolutionize digital psychiatry in combination with previously described tools and means based on multimodal physiological features, wearable and wireless devices, machine learning and edge and cloud computing. Sustainability of any long-term solution in war zones will depend on the proposed approach, bringing the new vision on how to cope with and overcome the invisible wounds of war trauma."
566,"War, emotions, mental health, and artificial intelligence","Training Chat GPT for such a specific strategic communication issue requires fine-tuning the model on a dataset relevant for the selected use cases. The collection of war domain-specific datasets from different local data sources should reflect the emotional and mental states covering a wide range of scenarios and questions that users might encounter within the selected use case domain. After cleaning and preprocessing the collected data to remove noise and tokenization, the preprocessed dataset is used to fine-tune a pre-trained ChatGPT model. Techniques like transfer learning might be used to leverage the knowledge already encoded in the pre-trained model. Training the fine-tuned model on the selected use case specific dataset is monitored by tracking metrics such as loss and validation performance. Once training is completed, evaluation of the performance of the fine-tuned model using validation data, or by manually testing it with sample inputs from related domain. Once the model has satisfied required performance metrics, it can be deployed in an EBSC campaigning process. Continuous monitoring of its performance in production requires its fine-tuning based on user feedback and real-world usage. Real time monitoring and tracking of emotional dynamics based on different data sources with a variety of NLP tools and methods within specific war zone and consequently mental health states deteriorations is extremely important.

The best information contents, context, and emotional properties delivered by EBSC are related to ideas and emotions that quickly resonate among targeted audiences and cause a small incremental positive emotional step toward desirable dominant emotional maps (?osi? et al., 2018). In other words, EBSC must be delivered as a comprehensive communication strategy through which individual and group emotions are reshaped in a more positive manner, producing and shaping ?soft power? important for reaching the desired emotional end state (?osi? et al., 2012a).�Figure 2�illustrates the transformation of a negative dominant emotional map of a war-inflicted society to a desirable more positive dominant emotional map, which could be facilitated by EBSC. Redirection of attention of more vulnerable individuals or selected groups from dominant negative emotions to more positive emotions may change how people appraise their current war situation, stimulating incremental emotional transformation toward more positive emotional and mental states."
568,"War, emotions, mental health, and artificial intelligence","Challenges for machine learning applications on wearable devices are related to the accuracy of machine learning models. Cross-validation techniques increase accuracy by testing the model on unseen data that have not been used in training (Sabry et al., 2022). Model interpretability is crucial, especially in wearable device applications in healthcare, where users need understandable results. Model size also matters for wearable devices due to memory constraints, as does computational complexity for inference and online training. Past obstacles in model development include data collection, feature selection, and model evaluation, highlighting the need for caution in relying on machine learning decisions. Healthcare models must generalize well, handle unseen examples, consider personal attributes, offer interpretable results, and communicate outcomes carefully (Sabry et al., 2022)."
569,"War, emotions, mental health, and artificial intelligence","Model development based on extracted features and sophisticated and complex innovative machine learning algorithms can be used for classification of certain mental disorders. For example, activity monitoring and recognition by text messages, location, movement, touch screen typing patterns, and voice recordings can assist in mental health monitoring and diagnostics. However, the interpretation of the impact of certain statistical features on classification or other outcome variables can often be challenging. Furthermore, the precision of a model can be adversely impacted by the incorporation of irrelevant characteristics (Sabry et al., 2022). It is important to note that the notion of ?more is better? does not always hold true, as the inclusion of domain-specific features that possess expressive qualities tends to yield superior performance. For instance, features such as heart rate, breathing rate, changes in acceleration, motion jerk, and transient alterations in skin resistance can be considered as domain-specific features for seizure detection (Sabry et al., 2022). In certain applications, the focus lies on changes occurring over extended periods, while in others, attention is directed toward transient changes resulting from specific events like fall detection and emotion recognition. The growing array of wearable devices can lead to big changes in the prevention of chronic mental health diseases by continuous measurements to identify which patterns are normal and which are abnormal. Continuous measurements make it possible to establish which patterns are normal for a specific individual, such as respiration or heart rate, and can assist in recognizing important deviations before disease develops."
570,"War, emotions, mental health, and artificial intelligence","Wearable and wireless sensors and sensing technology using a variety of AI algorithms can be applied in the prediction of different mental health disorders by monitoring human physiology, emotion, cognition, and behavior (Lee et al., 2021;�Kalisperakis et al., 2023;�Sigcha et al., 2023;�Zheng et al., 2023). Majority of applications are deployed on smartphones or configured with a chatbot interface via a web application for providing access to a larger population offering a unique opportunity for ubiquitous mental health screening. Connected and embedded into people?s personal lives, smartphones provide considerable insight into individual routines, habits, activities, and human way of living. The convergence of sensor networks, fusion of sensors, processing of signals, and human interaction with these devices result in a vast amount of data, which serves as a valuable source for extracting intricate characteristics utilized by machine learning algorithms (Sabry et al., 2022). These algorithms are then able to identify and acquire meaningful patterns that aid in the prediction of potential mental health disorders. Wearable devices have the capacity to incorporate a range of sensor types, enabling the continuous monitoring of various bodily signals. Consequently, these devices can gather an extensive amount of data, potentially reaching millions of data points per person per day. Such information can be utilized by a range of machine learning techniques, like deep neural networks, for the purposes of training, learning, and predictive modeling (?osi? et al., 2024). Smart wearables supported by AI can be very helpful in digital psychiatry to provide care to millions of potential patients simultaneously and can be used for clinical purposes to track patients with greater care and accuracy (Chen et al., 2022;�Shajari et al., 2023). A large amount of the biometric data can be analyzed on edge computing devices enabling developers to secure sensitive data and enhance security and privacy. Based on innovation in new sensors technology and sophisticated algorithms, wearables can be used as diagnostic devices using machine learning models built on data streaming from each individual. It might be also very helpful to enhance traditional conventional face-to-face therapies which currently represent a serious barrier to care. These devices can resolve many problems regarding potential massive mental health problems induced by war traumas, natural disasters or pandemics."
571,"War, emotions, mental health, and artificial intelligence","Digital therapeutic devices and apps based on cognitive behavioral therapy and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) might be an additional transformative and powerful approach in psychiatry of the 21st century leading toward highly efficient diagnosis and treatment as complementary assistance to traditional face-to-face therapy (Tong et al., 2022;�G�rriz et al., 2023). A virtual digital therapist might be as good as a human therapist based on the enormous potential of AI-based tools and means. Such applications offer great promise since they only require smart wearables sensors and smartphones. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of evidence-based psychotherapy that is often recognized by the Institute of Medicine as the first-line approach to provide behavioral, cognitive, and emotional change and adaption to a range of common psychological and psychiatric problems (David et al., 2018). Finally, to the personalization of online CBT and XAI treatments using minimal human resources is an important research topic which deserves much more attention, particularly regarding the issues of optimal adaptive treatments, selection of best treatments, minimization of dropouts etc."
572,"War, emotions, mental health, and artificial intelligence","Currently, deep machine learning (DL) methods receive more attention and perform better than traditional machine learning methods, while the interpretable models, like XAI, deserve particular attention. DL methods can capture valuable features automatically without feature engineering and may be preferred for tasks of mental illness detection from text. DL methods consist of multiple layers, including an embedding layer and a classification layer (Zhang et al., 2022). The embedding layer has the ability to retain both semantic and syntactic information, thereby enhancing the training of deep learning models. Various embedding techniques exist, such as ELMo, GloVe word embedding, word2vec, and contextual language encoder representations like bidirectional encoder representations transformers (BERT). Depending on the structure of the classification layer, DL methods might be divided into convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), transformer-based methods, and hybrid-based methods (Zhang et al., 2022). DL models have shown high accuracy in predicting mental health disorder diagnosis and severity (Garriga et al., 2022;�Alles?e et al., 2023)."
573,"War, emotions, mental health, and artificial intelligence","Disruptive AI-based technologies using machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), neuro linguistic programming (NLP), cloud infrastructure, and new digital therapeutic apps offer a significant promise for enhancing mental health care on a worldwide scale, rendering these approaches more cost-effective and readily implementable, specifically targeting nations and individuals lacking sufficient access to health care (Schwalbe and Wahl, 2020;�Lekkas and Jacobson, 2021;�Koutsouleris et al., 2022;�Tutun et al., 2023). Due to an inadequate number of psychiatrists and limited psychiatric resources to cope with war-related disasters, traumas and tragedies, new digital therapeutic wearable devices supported by advanced statistical methods and machine learning algorithms might represent a positive shift in the psychiatry of the future (?osi? et al., 2021). The predictive AI-based methods which can recognize potential chronic psychopathology early enough compared to traditional reactive psychiatry is example of more proactive and preventive type of medicine (?osi? et al., 2020a,b,�2021;�Bertl et al., 2022). The major advantage of predictive AI is its ability to identify specific non-obvious patterns which are beyond human observation capabilities and may be essential for early detection of individuals at high risk of mental health deterioration (?osi? et al., 2021). These AI-based tools and means are leading to a new era of mental health global management offering new opportunities and a more holistic approach to patients by early intervention with novel therapeutic methods (Schwalbe and Wahl, 2020;�Garriga et al., 2022;�Koutsouleris et al., 2022). These changes can be objectively assessed by state-of-the-art wearable devices which can capture clusters of different multimodal and multidisciplinary features focusing on early prediction and prevention of potential chronic mental health disorders using new AI-based therapeutic strategies, like computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (Wilhelm et al., 2020;�Grodniewicz and Hohol, 2023;�Khawaja and B�lisle-Pipon, 2023). Early prediction and prevention of mental health disorders, particularly for populations in war zones, based on the objective measurement and computation of relevant neuro-psycho-physiological and linguistic features and a machine learning model development of highly heterogeneous data sets, may enhance traditional face-to-face therapy. Such approach is particularly important for all of those who are exposed to high levels of stress during war time and need assistance more quickly and accurately."
574,"War, emotions, mental health, and artificial intelligence","Dominant emotional maps can display data or signals from different sources, like linguistic textual records related to emotion from social media which are increasingly popular. Individuals experiencing mental health issues frequently express their psychological difficulties through various platforms and forums, such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, and other online forums, by sharing text messages, comments, photos, videos, and other related information (Naslund et al., 2020;�Zhang et al., 2022,�2023). A differentiating characteristic of Reddit, when compared to other sources of data, is the classification of posts into distinct subreddits based on specific subjects, such as anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and even suicide (Zhang et al., 2022). In addition, electronic health records (EHR) function as a valuable source of secondary healthcare data, providing comprehensive documentation of individuals? historical medical records. Another viable approach involves identifying mental illness by conducting user interviews and subsequently analyzing the linguistic information obtained from transcribed clinical interviews (Morales and Levitan, 2016;�Spruit et al., 2022). Finally, the application of standardized questionnaires for individual?s diagnosis and self-assessment is also considered fitting in this circumstance (?osi? et al., 2021)."
575,"War, emotions, mental health, and artificial intelligence","Emotions affect attention, beliefs, and actions, focusing and guiding memory and influencing our cognitive processes (Tyng et al., 2017). They shape and strengthen our beliefs, help us rearrange our priorities and revise our goal hierarchies, influence our preferences, and act as a nexus among our beliefs, value systems and thereby strengthening our commitments (Gonzalez et al., 2020;�Furman, 2024;�Kisley et al., 2024)."
576,"War, emotions, mental health, and artificial intelligence","Group dominant emotional maps arise from the aggregation of emotional maps of individual members within a population (?osi? et al., 2012a), and serve as representations of ?dominant emotions,? which are publicly expressed feelings of collective behavior (Lofland, 1985). Additionally, they can be understood as depictions of ?emotional atmospheres,? which encompass collective moods, or as ?emotional climates,? which encompass collections of significant emotions or feelings that contribute to the formation and maintenance of political and social identities, as well as collective behavior (Barbalet, 1998;�De Rivera et al., 2007). The synchronous alteration of dominant emotions among substantial portions of the population can potentially act as a driving force or leverage for broader societal transformations. The nuanced, but simultaneous modification of individuals? feelings at the micro-level could lead to far-reaching transformations at the macro-level. Consequently, changes in dominant emotions entail shifts in the action tendencies of numerous individuals, thereby providing a basis for cohesive collective action on a societal scale."
577,"War, emotions, mental health, and artificial intelligence","An approach to use emotions as a mechanism to explain irrational behavior of war actors might be an innovative way to add value in searching for a solution for the most complex, unpredictable and uncertain war conflicts in the modern world. In order to reconcile people with diverse emotional landscapes, it is necessary to understand the main drivers of their behaviors and actions. Behavioral characteristics of people cannot be understood without deeper and complex analysis of their dominant emotional maps and their socio-cultural and security conditions and interactions. Different dominant emotions of the population must reflect in different policy ramifications (Mercer, 2005). This indicates that different societal and cultural values and norms cannot be easily changed by excessive use of military power. Finally, the effects of military dominance, like airstrikes or drone attacks, may produce strong negative emotions and effects in the battle for hearts and minds of a war inflicted population, making the use of military power a less effective (Dixon, 2009). Potential military failure might be a consequence of unrealistic expectations that serious security problems in war-inflicted societies can be resolved by the military while ignoring the fact that the post-conflict developmental and recovery programs are the most crucial (Galula, 1964)."
578,"War, emotions, mental health, and artificial intelligence","The explosion of negative emotions and their impact on relationship between nations, cultures, and religions is a crucial important topic which deserves much more attention. Without understanding the pivotal influence of emotions, which have greater control over individuals than they exert on them, it is fundamentally impossible to grasp the political and security realities of war trauma (?osi? et al., 2012b;�Webster and Albertson, 2022). For example, fear as absence of confidence can lead to obsessive worries about the present and the future and become more dangerous for overall security and individuals? mental health. At the same time, fear is a force for survival in a dangerous environment and a natural protective response. Anger involves appraisals of relative strength and coping potential, while hatred is the strongest, extreme emotion which is characterized by willingness to harm and even annihilate the hated individual or hated group. However, war traumatic events can challenge and uproot related attachments, making their emotional nature exposed in a very visible manner (Bleiker and Hutchison, 2008)."
579,"War, emotions, mental health, and artificial intelligence","The war-related death toll represents only the visible wounds of war, while numerous other consequences, such as the invisible wounds of war, like PTSD and suicides, are not yet efficiently and adequately addressed and treated. Potential of new mental health artificial intelligence (AI) tools and means might be effectively used in early recognition and treatment of mental health challenges. Therefore, this paper aims to address the capacity of a more comprehensive approach based on AI state-of-the-art tools and means to provide effective utility in coping with this global health challenge, particularly in societies affected by wars and traumas. Consequences of war, including forced displacement, exposure to violence, supplies? deficiencies, damages to essential infrastructure, and disruption of vital services, can exert significant adverse effects on the psychological well-being and overall health of the Ukrainian population during and after the war (Hamama-Raz et al., 2022;�Ellis et al., 2024). Measures of standard of living, psychological well-being, depressive symptoms, substance misuse, and consumption of unhealthy foods are commonly linked to the conflict regardless of sex, age, religion, or marital status (Konstantinov et al., 2023a,b). Our research highlights the importance of emotions as a motivating factor for engaging in voluntary service as well, since the majority of volunteers emphasized that feelings of compassion, anger, and a willingness influenced their decision to engage (Domaradzki et al., 2022)."
580,"War, emotions, mental health, and artificial intelligence","During the war time dysregulation of negative emotions such as fear, anger, hatred, frustration, sadness, humiliation, and hopelessness can overrule normal societal values, culture, and endanger global peace and security, and mental health in affected societies. Therefore, it is understandable that the range and power of negative emotions may play important roles in consideration of human behavior in any armed conflict. The estimation and assessment of dominant negative emotions during war time are crucial but are challenged by the complexity of emotions? neuro-psycho-physiology. Currently available natural language processing (NLP) tools have comprehensive computational methods to analyze and understand the emotional content of related textual data in war-inflicted societies. Innovative AI-driven technologies incorporating machine learning, neuro-linguistic programming, cloud infrastructure, and novel digital therapeutic tools and applications present an immense potential to enhance mental health care worldwide. This advancement could make mental health services more cost-effective and readily accessible. Due to the inadequate number of psychiatrists and limited psychiatric resources in coping with mental health consequences of war and traumas, new digital therapeutic wearable devices supported by AI tools and means might be promising approach in psychiatry of future. Transformation of negative dominant emotional maps might be undertaken by the simultaneous combination of online cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on individual level, as well as usage of emotionally based strategic communications (EBSC) on a public level. The proposed positive emotional transformation by means of CBT and EBSC may provide important leverage in efforts to protect mental health of civil population in war-inflicted societies. AI-based tools that can be applied in design of EBSC stimuli, like Open AI Chat GPT or Google Gemini may have great potential to significantly enhance emotionally based strategic communications by more comprehensive understanding of semantic and linguistic analysis of available text datasets of war-traumatized society. Human in the loop enhanced by Chat GPT and Gemini can aid in design and development of emotionally annotated messages that resonate among targeted population, amplifying the impact of strategic communications in shaping human dominant emotional maps into a more positive by CBT and EBCS."
581,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"It is possible that exploring these two fusion approaches could allow for a more sophisticated handling of modalities, as well as lead to a potential improvement of the accuracy and robustness of identifying mental health disorder markers."
582,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"In the�??0.25�operationalization,�??�is set to 0.25, indicating that precision is considered more important than recall. This alteration of the original F1 metric is recommended in cases where the consequences of false positives are crucial. For instance, in our project, we might prefer falsely marking a few samples as marker-including (higher precision) over missing too many actual markers (lower recall)."
583,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"Text-speech alignment would not only enable the extraction of additional important features (speech ratio�and�pause duration), but also the option of experimenting with deeper deep learning models, like GRUs and LSTMs. These models excel in processing sequences where the timing and order of inputs are crucial to understanding the data?s context and dynamics. The alignment is particularly important in tasks where the synchronization of spoken words and vocal characteristics adds value to the interpretation. GRUs, for instance, are tailored to handle sequences by capturing dependencies at different time steps. In order for the GRU to effectively analyze the responses of the textual information to the speech variations (e.g. speech rate, pauses, intonation, etc), it is crucial for the two modalities to be properly aligned."
584,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"The finding of this study can potentially play a very important role in the development of practical mental health screening or monitoring tools. The study provides not only an extensive list of linguistic and acoustic mental disorder markers, but also some experiments and comparison between unimodal and multimodal approaches. Through the identification of linguistic and acoustic mental disorder markers, this research opens a path towards early, non-invasive screening systems. It should be possible to develop applications, meant for both clinicians and individuals, that utilize these markers in order to monitor mental health states in real-time. These applications could work by receiving as input data of different modalities, like textual content, conversations or voice recordings, and in turn assess mental health conditions. One can consider such tools as an additional diagnostic layer in clinical settings or alternatively as part of remote mental health care, where patients can be monitored over time without requiring frequent clinical visits in person. Moreover, since markers like reduced pitch variability in depression or increased jitter and shimmer in anxiety have clear physiological correlations, they can provide objective, quantifiable data to complement traditional psychiatric assessments. This can lead to improved early detection, personalized treatment plans, and more accurate tracking of patient progress during therapy."
585,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"One of the challenges that we overcame was avoiding the loss of modality-specific insights. When merging features at an early stage, it sometimes becomes challenging to discern which modality is contributing to predictions and this can lead to reduced model interpretability. However, by creating three different sets of combined features (one of which represented the balance between the two modalities), we showed that for the majority of the models the best performing features set was the one with the 66% weight on the textual features. Then, for some of the models, the challenger was the features set that was only slightly skewed towards the textual modality. Yet, in none of the models did the balanced features set perform better than the other two. This clearly indicates that the textual features have more insight to offer in the identification of mental disorder markers, at least on the individual level."
586,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"Another limitation to this study was the dataset selection. Although DAIC-WOZ was a great asset for our project, it did limit our research because of its size and its specificity towards a couple of particular mental disorders. Moreover, because of the dataset?s interval overlaps in the transcript we had to avoid text-speech alignment; a process that has a fundamental role in multimodality, especially between the particular two modalities. Finally, we believe that implementing models with increased complexity could help to capture more nuanced details that might have been missed by simpler models."
587,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"To prevent overfitting, our initial approach was to use cross-validation instead of the traditional train-test-split approach, which proved to be effective. Not only did we observe a noticeable gap in the overfitting levels between the two approaches, but also cross-validation led to minimal, or at the worst case mild, levels of overfitting. We also noticed that overfitting was more prevalent with a higher number of features, which can be associated to the small size of the dataset compared to the number of features selected. Furthermore, during the mulimodal model?s experiments, we also implemented a regularization technique to our Logistic Regression model and added Dropout layers to our Dense Layers model. Although this had only a slight impact towards the prevention of overfitting, it had a larger impact on the model?s performance. The results of the Logistic Regression model after applying regularization dropped greatly across all metrics and number of features. Additionally, the F1 scores of the positive cases decreased by 60%. This was due to the low recall rate. For each features set the model has a precision rate of 100%, while the recall rate ranges between 7% and 10%. This is why, for the case of Logistic Regression, we moved on with the pre-regularization results. The overfitting level may be slightly higher but the model?s performance was not even comparable."
588,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"It?s not rare for text features to outperform audio features in tasks related to the particular topic. When it comes to identifying mental disorder markers, the text modality has proven to be extremely capable of leading to better predictions, even more so when there is a relevant textual content that offers clear linguistic markers. Although the text model significantly outperforms the audio model, we should still not diminish the value provided by the audio features. Analyzing these features can help discover distinct and complementary insights and this is where multimodal models, that utilize both of these modalities, can shine. By combining the strengths offered by each modality and implementing fusion techniques that bring forth those strengths, it is possible to capture more comprehensive information and details of mental health states."
589,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"Observing the performances of the two unimodal approaches, it is evident that the unimodal text model is by far outperforming the unimodal audio model. More importantly, this gap is even more intense in some of the classifiers. In the case of SVM and Logistic Regression, the text model achieves an��18%�higher accuracy and��32%�higher AUC-ROC score than the audio model, while the F1 score of 1s is higher by more than 60%. Similarly, for Dense Layers the audio model attains an accuracy��15%�lower and an AUC-ROC��20%�lower than the text model. On the other hand, in the case of Random Forest, which shows the best performance for the audio model, the gap in accuracy is only��12%�and the gap in AUC-ROC score is barely 10%. Concerning the F1 score of 1s metric however, we can still observe a performance difference of more than 20%."
590,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"Table�16, presents a comparison between the three modality approaches, for each model, using the best performing features in each case."
591,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"For reference, unlike the unimodal text model, the audio model under-performed with any additional amount of features (tested with 25 and 30 features as well). This indicates that our models cannot handle and learn the same with the acoustic features, as they did with the textual ones."
592,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,The results shown in Table�14�represent the performance of our models when tested on the features of the�RFE with Random Forest�selector. The columns of the table represent the same values as the columns of the corresponding table (Table�13) of the unimodal text model.
593,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"Overall, while testing for overfitting by comparing the train and test set metrics, we noticed some mild overfitting (on average about 5% gap between the train and test set performances). However, due to all the mitigation measures taken and the use of cross validation, we deem this modest amount of overfitting acceptable in this case."
594,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"In Table�13�we demonstrate the results achieved by our models, using the features set recommended by the best performing selector approach; i.e. RFE with Logistic Regression and with additional scaling. As discussed earlier, k-fold cross-validation was implemented to our models, and since every fold of the cross validation produced a different accuracy and AUC-ROC score, we modified our script so that it returned the mean cv values of all folds. As such, in Table�13, ?Accuracy? represents the�mean CV accuracy�and ?AUC-ROC? represents the�mean CV AUC-ROC score�across all folds. Moreover, ?F1 - 0s? and ?F1 - 1s? represent the F1 scores achieved when predicting the absence and the presence of mental disorder markers, respectively. For the three machine learning models we used a random state seed, so regardless of how many times we reran the models the results did not deviate much from the ones presented in the table. On the other hand, in the case of the deep learning model, every run produced different results (with observable variance) and as such we are providing the best scores out of four runs for each set of features."
595,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"When the feature elimination and selection process were complete, we observed that certain features stood out across all methods and settings. First of all, we noticed a consistency in the appearance of the�?anx?, ?sad?, ?they?�and�?death?�LIWC categories. This indicates that these psychological and thematic aspects of the text are highly relevant to the identification of mental health disorder markers. Their consistent presence underscores the significance of emotional and thematic content in the analysis. Apart from LIWC categories, there were also some GloVe dimensions that were repeatedly selected. This consistency of certain GloVe dimensions suggests that they capture key semantic features relevant to the identification of language markers associated with mental health diseases. Another feature that was prevalent, across the various feature selectors, was�PCA2. In the context of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the second principal component (PCA2) accounts for the next highest variance after the first principal component (PCA1). The fact that PCA2 appears more than PCA1 implies that PCA2 captures significant aspects of the data that are not captured by PCA1. Finally, concerning our last type of textual features, POS Tag counts, we noticed that�?VBG_count?�(verb, gerund or present participle) and�?JJR_count?�(comparative adjective) both belonged to the top 15 features selected across all feature selectors. The frequency of the first one points to the syntactic structures of sentences as informative features, while the frequency of the latter suggests that certain grammatical constructs may play a role in distinguishing texts related to mental health. Overall, features that appear consistently tend to be less sensitive to variations in the modeling process or data sampling, making them reliable choices for critical analyses."
596,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"For all three modality approaches we used cross-validation, instead of the typical train-test split. Not only is cross-validation (K-fold) more reliable but it also helps to efficiently assess the models? effectiveness and prevent them from overfitting. To illustrate, Fig.�3�visualizes both the unimodal (Fig.�3a) and multimodal (Fig.�3b) configurations for the neural network-based models."
597,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,The features from each unimodal model were selected based on the top 20 features proposed by the best performing feature selector of the corresponding modality; i.e.�RFE with Logistic Regression and rescaling�for text and�RFE with Random Forest�for acoustic.
598,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"To move on with this modality concatentation, first we created two sets of features from each unimodal model. From the textual model we created a set with 20 features and one with 15 features and from the acoustic model we extracted a set of 15 features and another with 10 features. The difference in the feature sets sizes is due to the preliminary results, which indicated that the acoustic model performed obviously worse than the text model."
599,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"As indicated by the flowchart (see Fig.�1), the features of Table�11�were then used to train our models."
600,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,The final acoustic features set exceeded 150 feature columns and as such we proceeded with the same feature selection methodology as we did with the unimodal text model. The exact same experiments are performed and the selector with the best performance in this model is RFE with Random Forest.
601,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,Feature aggregation eventually led to a complete features set that merged all the extracted acoustic features and their statistics; with everything expressing a single overall value for each interview.
602,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"In order to be able to compare all of our features and perform feature selection properly, we harmonized all features to the same unit of analysis, i.e. the interview level. To achieve that, we aggregated all of our segmented-level features back to the interview level by extracting the mean, median and standard deviation of all the segments? values per interview."
603,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"The feature selection for the audio model was based on the proposed features throughout the literature and the related work. Moreover, as demonstrated by the marker tables in the ?Background? section, most of the extracted acoustic features have been identified as related with one or more mental disorders. Among all those features, pitch was one of the most popular with a presence percentage of about 90%. It has been described as a good indicator in mental health disorder identification, specifically for identifying emotional states or stress. The fundamental frequency F0 mean, which indicates the lowest frequency of the speech signal is perceived as pitch (mean, median). Jitter and shimmer were also very popular features across the literature review. Overall, jitter calculates the voice frequency?s stability and is often chosen as a measure for the detection of voice disorders or vocal pathologies. In short, jitter shows the variations in pitch. In the case of shimmer, it is actually an evaluation measure for the stability of amplitude in the voice. Like jitter, shimmer is critical in diagnosing and researching voice quality. Lower Harmonics to Noise Ratio (HNR) indicates a breathy, hoarse voice, which reflects reduced vocal clarity and is also associated with various mental illnesses. Finally, MFCC coefficients capture spectral features of the voice and have been used to identify disorders such as schizophrenia and PTSD, where vocal tract dynamics and speech patterns are affected."
604,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"Regarding the feature extraction, we used the�librosa�and�praat-parselmouth�libraries in order to extract�pitch, jitter, shimmer, Harmonics to Noise Ratio (HNR), 13 MFCC coefficients�and�energy. Specifically, for jitter, we extracted�jitter local, jitter ppq5�and�jitter absolute�and for shimmer we extracted�shimmer local�and�shimmer apq5. All of these features were extracted on the segment level, as feature extraction was applied on every single segment of every interview."
605,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"Once again, the initial step of the methodology involves data preprocessing, and particularly noise reduction and audio file segmentation. First, we performed noise reduction, specifically spectral subtraction, on all our audio files. The particular noise reduction method works well for constant noise like hums or hisses, while still preserving the quality of speech. Then, to verify the method?s successful application, we used the�Audacity�software and listened through 15 to 20 samples. Through this testing, we noticed that�audio file #300�included a particular noise that couldn?t be cleared away, and hence it was removed from our dataset along with the corresponding transcript."
606,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"As the left flowchart of Fig.�1�illustrates, the final step of the unimodal text model?s methodology was testing the models? performance. To do that, we used the aforementioned features set as input to our four ML models and we evaluated its performance using the four predefined evaluation metrics."
607,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"Then, the second parameter we experimented with was the inclusion or exclusion of re-scaling during the feature selection process. As seen at Table�9, all parameter combinations were tested with and without additional scaling. Moreover, it can be observed that Random Forest isn?t? influenced at all by the presence or absence of re-scaling, while Logistic Regression provides completely different results in each case."
608,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"In order to identify the optimal number of features and the most suitable predictive model for the selection of these features, we experimented by tuning various parameters. Table�9�demonstrates the parameters of these experiments."
609,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"Category ?i? has the lowest threshold because of its lower distribution. Categories ?social? and ?cogproc? have a dual threshold. Lower values on ?social? aimed to capture potential social withdrawal and upper values aimed to capture potential excessive social referencing. Similarly, lower thresholds in ?cogproc? aimed to capture disorganized thinking (for instance, for schizophrenia) and upper thresholds aimed to capture higher cognitive processing (for instance, overthinking in the case of OCD). In further research we will further investigate and validate this binary label creation process."
610,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"Utilizing all the information obtained up to this point, we created 10 initial threshold sets. Some of the sets were sensitivity focused, meaning that they had lower thresholds that aimed to capture even less obvious cases and other sets were more specificity focused, meaning that they were stricter and aimed to capture the more extreme cases. Table�6�illustrates the first experimental sets and the ?Marker Presence? column refers to the percentage of samples that were flagged as including a language marker."
611,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"As part of our research for identifying potential mental disorder markers, we had to create a binary label that would serve as an indicator of our models? performance. Hence, we designed an intuitive and pragmatic labelling process, which emphasizes practicality and common sense to establish a scientific baseline. In order to cover for any lacking points and to fortify its validity, we performed a long series of experiments before creating the final set of binary labels. For this process we used our main dataset (DAIC-WOZ) and we focused on the majority of the mental disorders studied in this paper (i.e. Depression, Bipolar Disorder, Schizophrenia, PTSD and even ASD)."
612,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"The inclusion of POS-Tag counts as features was a novel addition from our side. Unlike the previous linguistic features, the particular features do not have an established clinical basis within the existing literature on mental health disorders. However, based on our review, we observed that certain mental disorders are frequently associated with linguistic markers such as self-focused language or the use of third-person plural/singular pronouns. Therefore, we hypothesized that including a feature that can keep track of and count the pronoun instances could enhance our ability to capture these patterns and provide valuable insights to our research."
613,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"In order to complement our feature set further, we also extracted some information on relevant POS-tags. More specifically, we applied tokenization and part-of-speech (POS) tagging in the cleaned text files, using the�nltk�package. Through this, we downloaded the necessary components for tokenization and POS tagging. Table�4�shows the selected POS-Tags counts that we used in this study."
614,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"In the case of clustering, each of the created clusters represents a group of texts that have similar LIWC metrics with each other. Using the average values of these metrics as our criterion, we deduced the dominant characteristics of each cluster?s text segments. At this point, the extracted information can be used for both comparative analysis (for instance, noticing that a cluster has significantly higher scores in posemo (positive emotions) can mean that it has a more positive tone compared to others) and for contextual understanding (i.e. drawing hypothesis or identifying patterns based on what the clusters represent). The particular figure (Fig.�2) illustrates the comparison of average scores across different LIWC categories for the four identified clusters (0, 1, 2 and 3). For a certain cluster, each bar shows the normalized average score within a particular LIWC metric. For instance, by observing the scores on the ?sad? category, it is noticeable that clusters 0 and 2 display negative average values, indicating a lower presence of language associated to sad themes. Cluster 1, on the other hand, shows an exceptionally high average score, which suggests that the participants or text samples within this cluster are more involved with sadness-related themes and language. The ?negemo? category displays a similar trend, where cluster 1 shows one of the highest positive averages. This alignment indicates that the contents of cluster 1 are notably more negative compared to the other three clusters. Overall, the figure highlights how the four distinct clusters differ in their emotional and linguistic patterns and it is shown that cluster 1, specifically, consistently scores higher in categories such as ?sad? and ?negemo?, which are associated with negative affect."
615,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"?<Not mappable>? refers to some language markers that could not be correlated to a specific category and we are including them in the table only for demonstration purposes. Moreover, since this table provides only a sample of the mental illnesses included in our research, some other relevant categories are not present. This refers to the�anx, we, you, they, bio�and�relativ�categories."
616,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"Given the structure of the transcripts available by the DAIC-WOZ dataset, where the speaker is identified in the ?speaker? column (can be either ?Participant? or ?Ellie?, the virtual agent), we modified the script so that it selectively kept only the responses given by the participant. Then, we concatenated all the responses of a single participant in a single string; this way we ended up with 189 strings with an average length of 7306 words. Moving on, to address clustering, we performed the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters for our data [30]. Given a range of cluster numbers, this method plots the sum of squared distances of samples to their closest cluster center. Then, by examining the plot, we identified that point in which the decrease acutely changes, similar to looking at an elbow at a ninety degree hold. The particular point is the one that most often represents the optimal number of clusters. The resulting plots indicated that the most suitable number of clusters is either 4 or 5, where the inertia showed the smallest decrease.�Furthermore, we confirmed the optimal number of clusters found using the Elbow method with the Silhouette method [31]. Finally, the text preprocesing that was done for the GloVe vectors involved the removal of english stopwords, tokenization and lower-casing."
617,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"The first step was to choose what features would be extracted, in order to preprocess the data accordingly. On that note, the selected features for the text model included�Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)�categories,�GloVe embeddings, K-means clustering�and�Part of Speech Tags (POS-Tags) counts."
618,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"Having identified, through literature research, a variety of mental illnesses? markers and having acquired the dataset, the next step was to create three different models, one unimodal text model, one unimodal acoustic model and one multimodal model that combined both. This setup would enable the comparison between the unimodal and multimodal approaches. For the sake of a fair comparison, we trained the same machine learning models (i.e. SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression and a FCNN (Dense Layers)) through each approach and we evaluated their performance using four particular evaluation metrics, namely accuracy, AUC-ROC score and two variances of the F1 score (F1 of positive cases (F1 of 1s) and F1 of negative cases (F1 of 0s))."
619,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"A downside of�DAIC-WOZ�is its relatively small size. Regarding this, it was unfortunate that we had to exclude one of the 189 samples, as it included a lot of noise to the point that neither noise reduction methods, nor external programs like Audacity could help fix it."
620,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"Concerning our dataset, we managed to acquire the�DAIC-WOZ�dataset, which is a set of clinical interviews designed specifically to help diagnose depression, PTSD and anxiety [32]. The dataset includes interviews taking place between a human-controlled, virtual interviewer called ?Ellie? and a number of real participants. Three modalities are present in this database, namely transcript, audio and video. Although, the list of mental disorders included is limited compared to ours, it is still the most suitable dataset that is publicly available."
621,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"The identified linguistic and acoustic markers were systematically derived from previous empirical studies on the particular field. Each of these studies examined how specific features in these two modalities correlate with underlying mental health illnesses. Based on all of these related works, which are cited in Tables�1�and�2, the identified markers were selected based on their ability to capture fundamental symptoms and behavioral characteristics associated with each mental health disorder. For instance, schizophrenia-alike disorders are linked to disorganized speech patterns and a lack of coherence, which match with the disorder?s characteristic cognitive disturbances. Similarly, markers such as self-focused language (increased use of first-person singular pronouns) in depression reflect an increased self-focus, which has been proven to be a common depressive symptom. In the case of the speech modality, acoustic features, such as reduced pitch variability in major depressive disorder or heightened jitter and shimmer in anxiety disorders, have been previously identified as indicative of the psychomotor and physiological changes that often accompany these conditions. By identifying these markers, researchers aim to map observable speech and language features with the cognitive, emotional, and neurological dysfunctions that are characteristic of each mental disorder. This connection not only enhances our understanding of the clinical presentation of these conditions but also provides a foundation for the development of objective, speech-based diagnostic tools. Each marker is considered relevant because it taps into key symptomatic domains of the disorders, as demonstrated through robust statistical analyses and cross-study validations in our literature. This is the first comprehensive overview of Linguistic and Speech markers for Mental Health Disorders."
622,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"In Table�1, we are presenting our findings with regards to mental health markers that can be identified from textual data. The identified markers are applicable to a wide range of mental disorders, as has been shown in the listed studies. This comprehensive list of language markers were gathered through an extensive research and literature review."
623,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"Concerning the feature extraction, papers [1,�3,�6,�8?10] demonstrated the strengths of Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) for the text model. LIWC is a toolkit of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to calculate the number of words of certain categories that are used in a text based on a dictionary�[1,�33]. Similarly, other related works (e.g. [11?13]) extracted GloVe embeddings and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Cooefficients (MFCCs), for the text and audio models, respectively. The GloVe model is a well known vector space representation of a global word-word cooccurrences matrix [34], while MFCCs are well known for their ability to detect emotions from acoustic signals [35]."
624,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"In conclusion, by refining the binary label creation process and by improving the feature engineering process of the unimodal acoustic model, we argue that the multimodal model can outperform both unimodal approaches. This study underscores the importance of multimodal integration in the field of mental health diagnostics and sets the stage for future research to explore more sophisticated fusion techniques and deeper learning models."
625,Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health,"For this study we used the well known and robust multimodal DAIC-WOZ dataset derived from clinical interviews. Here we focus on the modalities text and audio. First, we constructed two unimodal models to analyze text and audio data, respectively, using feature extraction, based on the extensive list of mental disorder markers that has been identified and compiled by us using related and earlier studies. For our unimodal text model, we also propose an initial pragmatic binary label creation process. Then, we employed an early fusion strategy to combine our text and audio features before model processing. Our fused feature set was then given as input to various baseline machine and deep learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regressions, Random Forests, and fully connected neural network classifiers (Dense Layers). Ultimately, the performance of our models was evaluated using accuracy, AUC-ROC score, and two F1 metrics: one for the prediction of positive cases and one for the prediction of negative cases."
626,Transatlantic transferability and replicability of machine-learning algorithms to predict mental health crises,"SHAP values31�were used to measure the contribution of each feature to the models. In particular, we applied the TreeExplainer algorithm, a technique developed to interpret at a local level tree based Machine Learning models through additive feature attribution53. This method was run on each trained model and the feature attributions were computed for each prediction in the test set, assigning a numerical score per feature corresponding to the feature?s influence in the predicted value. The most predictive features for each model were selected based on the average absolute SHAP values across predictions in the test set. The distribution of SHAP values on the test set corresponding to the 20 most predictive features is illustrated in Supplementary Figs.�1?6."
627,Transatlantic transferability and replicability of machine-learning algorithms to predict mental health crises,"Two distinct sets of metrics were used to evaluate the model?s performance on US data, ranking metrics, and classification metrics. The ranking metrics were the primary metrics as the prediction model is meant to provide a ranked list of patients by likelihood of having a crisis in the near future, at a weekly level. These metrics include the AUROC, AUPRC, precision@top100, and recall@top100, where the precision and recall of the model are computed based on the top 100 patients of the ranked list. The AUROC and AUPRC provide an aggregate measure of performance across all possible classification thresholds, based on the tradeoff between sensitivity (how accurately crisis is predicted) and specificity (how accurately non-crisis is detected), and between precision and recall respectively. As secondary metrics, we considered four classification metrics: sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1 score."
628,Transatlantic transferability and replicability of machine-learning algorithms to predict mental health crises,"All models except UK Original were trained (or tuned) on the training set, had their hyperparameters tuned on the validation set, and were ultimately trained a final time on both the training set and validation set combined with the best set of hyperparameters. UK Original is a model trained on the UK dataset and tested directly on US data. A particular case is the UK Tuned model, which is an instance of UK Original that was further tuned on US data using the same hyperparameters as UK Retrained. Every model was evaluated on the testing set and their output is a predicted risk score (between 0 and 1) indicating the likelihood of a crisis in the following four weeks."

In total, 70,259 unique CUI were extracted from patient notes. To select the most important CUI for the study cohort a three-step approach was used: first, select the 3,000 most common CUI and train a tf-idf model using the whole hospital cohort; second, filter the 10 most important CUI per patient in the study cohort, and compute the 100 most common CUI overall, across the study cohort (Supplementary Table�7); finally, the tf-idf algorithm was applied to the patient notes in the study cohort, restricted to the CUI selected in the second step."

639,Transatlantic transferability and replicability of machine-learning algorithms to predict mental health crises,"Crisis events tend to occur in quick succession, and patients are often closely monitored after one happens. For example, in New York, state guidelines recommend that patients have a psychiatric aftercare appointment scheduled within seven calendar days following discharge45. Therefore, we cluster related crisis events into a single crisis episode, defined as a set of crisis events preceded by one full week of stability, without any such events. Correspondingly, the target of our analysis is to predict whether the onset of a crisis episode, which is the initial event of the episode, will occur during the following 4 weeks."
640,Transatlantic transferability and replicability of machine-learning algorithms to predict mental health crises,"The processed dataset was split into training, validation and test sets, chronologically, as follows: the training set contains the weeks between week 7 of 2018 and week 48 of 2019; the validation set contains weeks 1 to 18 of 2020; and the test set contains weeks 23 to 40 of 2020. The 4-week gaps between the sets were chosen to avoid data leakage, since the prediction target has information about the following four weeks of a patient."

This reduced all of the vocabulary to a set of Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs) that link to medical terms and thereby removed Protected Health Information (PHI) like patient names. The temporality of these CUIs relative to the notes was retained and maintained for analysis. Structured data elements were extracted, and the date shifted to remove PHI."
642,Transatlantic transferability and replicability of machine-learning algorithms to predict mental health crises,"This project also highlights the value of data embedded within EHR systems. The next frontier will move toward the integration of this data with personal and mobile data sources that have shown important potential to track depressive symptoms37?41. The convergence of these approaches has the potential to help us create systemic approaches to population management of high-risk and high-cost conditions like depression. Moreover, on the machine learning aspect, the integration of multiple EHR systems can be leveraged by using privacy-preserving approaches that can train a single model while keeping data decentralized, including federated learning42,43."
643,Transatlantic transferability and replicability of machine-learning algorithms to predict mental health crises,"The findings from this paper have significant clinical implications. As we move toward precision medicine approaches for psychiatric spectrum conditions, there is significant potential value and cost savings in crisis prediction and the potential for early intervention in crisis pathways. Imagine a scenario where a patient is getting more depressed and at risk for suicide, and the algorithms alert a care management team to reach out to this patient as the trajectory begins rather than waiting for the event to take place."
644,Transatlantic transferability and replicability of machine-learning algorithms to predict mental health crises,"The main limitation of this work concerns the definition of a mental health crisis. Depending on the hospital system, this may or may not already exist, and even when it does exist, it can vary from one system to another. If a definition does not yet exist, then it needs to be created based on the EHR data available at that hospital and the inputs from clinical practitioners locally. Another limitation is related to the variability of EHR datasets. EHRs can vary in terms of granularity, level of detail, length of patient history, etc., and the transferability or replicability of a prediction model might be more variable if the two systems differ more significantly. In this study, one significant difference between the EHR systems was their granularity. While the UK dataset included both inpatient and outpatient records, the US dataset only included inpatient records. It is paramount that these sorts of differences are evaluated in practice, both during and after the implementation of a model such as the one described in our work34. Finally, we note that the study period overlapped with the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular for the periods of time used in the validation and test sets. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a decrease in acute medical service use that was not directly connected to the pandemic, including the utilization of mental health services."
645,Transatlantic transferability and replicability of machine-learning algorithms to predict mental health crises,"Overall, ranking metrics for all models (AUROC 0.799?0.837) replicated the results from previous studies on the prediction of mental health crises13,14,32,33�(AUROC 0.702-0.865). As for the classification metrics, we opted to set the specificity level at 85% and obtained sensitivity values in the range 55.4?67.6%, which are in line with the sensitivity of 58% from our previous work13, and higher than the sensitivity level of 14.0?29.3% reported in the prediction of crisis associated with depression32�(albeit at a higher specificity level). The precision values, and consequently the F1 score values, obtained are lower than those in other studies32,33�(Precision 0.10?0.65, F1 score 0.15?0.65), likely due to the high imbalance in our dataset."
646,Transatlantic transferability and replicability of machine-learning algorithms to predict mental health crises,"Furthermore, it is possible to replicate the methods used to create new features and models (US Structured, US CUIs tf-idf, US CUIs LDA) for a new hospital system, provided the resources exist for this analysis. Doing the replication at the methodology level led to the best-performing model (US CUIs tf-idf) by leveraging clinical notes, but this approach consumes more resources and requires expert knowledge."
647,Transatlantic transferability and replicability of machine-learning algorithms to predict mental health crises,"To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the transferability and replicability of machine learning models to predict mental health crises from EHRs across two very distinct healthcare systems. Moreover, the trained models demonstrated this transfer or replication could be done in various settings, depending on the availability of a previously trained model, historical data and resources for EHR analysis."
648,Transatlantic transferability and replicability of machine-learning algorithms to predict mental health crises,"Among the top 20 features of the UK Original model, 4 exhibited a constant value on US data: ?Never hospitalized?, ?Weeks since last referral from acute services?, ?Weeks since last discharge category internal? and ?Weeks since last contact not attended?. Regardless, the model is using them for making predictions on the new dataset because it was trained in a different system where the features were useful predictors of mental health crises. By fine-tuning the model with the new data, new trees are learned to correct the bias carried from the previous system that does not apply to the new system?s data. For instance, the second most important feature of the UK Tuned model becomes ?Number of crisis episodes"" (which was the fifth most predictive for UK Original), and some new features show up as highly predictive, such as ?Week sine? and ?Week cosine?, which encode information about the time of the year, while the impact of the less relevant features on US data is diminished. Nevertheless, the model does not ?unlearn"" the trees that were trained on the original dataset, which preserves the generalizability of the model to both datasets."
649,Transatlantic transferability and replicability of machine-learning algorithms to predict mental health crises,"Classification metrics are presented in Table 3. The cutoff point was selected in each case to be around 85% specificity in order to maintain a 15% false positive rate across models while comparing their sensitivity, precision, and F1 scores. The US CUI tf-idf model performed the best according to all classification metrics at 85% specificity, achieving almost 70% sensitivity."
650,Transatlantic transferability and replicability of machine-learning algorithms to predict mental health crises,"If we only consider those models that were only trained on structured data, UK Tuned is the model that has the highest performance in all ranking metrics, although US Structured?s metrics are comparable. It also tops the metrics that only consider the top 100 patients."
651,Transatlantic transferability and replicability of machine-learning algorithms to predict mental health crises,"An extended set of features was created from US data, with 87 structured features describing diagnosis, the most recent crisis and hospitalization, interventions and discharge information, and demographics (Supplementary Table�3).

652,Transatlantic transferability and replicability of machine-learning algorithms to predict mental health crises,"Six machine learning models were developed to predict mental health crises up to 4 weeks in advance, either relying on a set of features developed in the UK (UK Original, UK Retrained, UK Tuned models) or on an extended set of features, some of which derived from medical Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs), developed in the US (US Structured, US CUI tf-idf, US CUI LDA models). The models using UK features were either trained on UK data (UK Original model), on US data (UK Retrained model), or on a combination of both (UK Tuned model). The models using the extended set of features were solely trained on US data using either structured features (US Structured model) or a combination of structured and unstructured features (US CUI tf-idf, US CUI LDA models)."
653,Transatlantic transferability and replicability of machine-learning algorithms to predict mental health crises,"The process of transferring and replicating Machine Learning models across the two healthcare settings is depicted in Fig.�2. Two machine learning models trained in the UK healthcare system, UK Original, and UK Tuned, were transferred and evaluated for crisis prediction on US data, with the latter being further tuned on US data before evaluation. Another model, UK retrained, was trained on US data using a set of features designed for the UK system, which were then replicated using the US dataset. Finally, three new models were trained using novel feature sets tailored to the US dataset, replicating the methods used in the UK model development. Note that the replicated methods encompass the definition of modeling setup, aimed at predicting mental health crisis in the following 28 days, as well as the feature creation, both in terms of their outer structure (weekly basis) and the aspects of the patient?s journey that they cover (e.g., diagnosis, hospitalization, etc).

655,Transatlantic transferability and replicability of machine-learning algorithms to predict mental health crises,"In this study, we directly address this gap by exploring whether and how a UK-derived predictive algorithm can be effectively transferred and replicated in a US hospital context. Our prior research13,14, in a single test-bed, has demonstrated the efficacy of ML-based prediction of mental health crises 28 days ahead, utilizing EHRs from the Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust, a UK-based public healthcare provider. Herein, we investigate the feasibility of applying a UK model within a US healthcare environment, assessing its performance, and exploring potential enhancements through algorithm calibration to new data unique to the US. Given the multitude of approaches when defining a mental health crisis and the lack of global consensus across hospitals30, the target variable needs to be defined locally with each clinical provider. To thoroughly explore the transferability and replicability of our approach, we deploy and evaluate six discrete models, each delving into varying calibration strategies and feature sets?both structured data and language-based features. These models and features were created following standard ML techniques, advancing said techniques remains out of the scope of this study."
656,Transatlantic transferability and replicability of machine-learning algorithms to predict mental health crises,"In this regard, the ability to transfer and replicate predictive algorithms across healthcare systems represents one of the key enablers of the widespread adoption of machine learning not only in psychiatry but also in the broader healthcare spectrum. This entails unique and vital challenges, ranging from disparate data collection processes, data architectures, operational protocols, and patient demographics that vary considerably across different systems. These challenges appear both when transferring algorithms - where models trained on one specific dataset are implemented and evaluated in a different setting?, and when replicating them?where the approach and findings should be reproduced under new conditions. Additionally, how well the model performs when transferred or replicated is another critical aspect for the successful implementation. This is typically referred to as the models? generalizability, which describes the extent to which a model?s metrics remain consistent beyond the specific conditions and data used when training the algorithm."
657,Transatlantic transferability and replicability of machine-learning algorithms to predict mental health crises,"Recent decades have witnessed a consistent increase in the proportion of mental health-related visits to emergency departments1?3, a trend further accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic4. These visits stem primarily from individuals who are suffering mental health crises. In general, a mental health crisis, also called a mental health emergency, is a broad term that encompasses any situation in which a person?s actions, feelings, and behaviors put them at risk of hurting themselves or others, and/or prevent them from being able to care for themselves or function effectively in the community in a healthy manner5. Some examples include suicide attempts, psychosis, self-harm, or mental breakdowns. Accurate foresight or prediction of such crises would open new avenues for healthcare providers to not only manage their limited resources but to also proactively intervene. This proactive approach could mitigate the adverse effects on individuals while reducing the burden on healthcare infrastructures6,7."
658,The Use of Deep Learning and Machine Learning on Longitudinal Electronic Health Records for the Early Detection and Prevention of Diseases: Scoping Review,"Longitudinal EHRs have valuable potential to support the early detection of a variety of diseases. For various diseases, EHR data concerning diagnoses, procedures, vital signs, medication, laboratory tests, BMI, and (early) symptoms have a high predictive value. To analyze multivariable, longitudinal EHRs, a basic RNN and LSTM are the most suitable techniques. For the detection of diseases, using ML (including DL) on EHRs proved to be highly accurate. When the detection occurs at the same moment as the diagnosis of clinicians, it seems not directly relevant for the prevention of diseases. However, the detection of diseases offers the clinical benefits of preliminary screening to prioritize patients from the highest risk class. The prevention of diseases can be supported by ML models that are able to predict or detect diseases earlier than the current clinical practice. The additional information about the most important predictors of the individual and the biggest risk changers allow targeted prevention interventions and, therefore, personalized care. Improved health care policies and workload reduction are frequently cited benefits but have not yet been evaluated in clinical practice. Both ML and DL attempts for disease detection and prevention still remain in the testing and prototyping phase and have a long way to go to be clinically applied."
659,The Use of Deep Learning and Machine Learning on Longitudinal Electronic Health Records for the Early Detection and Prevention of Diseases: Scoping Review,"Another limitation was the data synthesis regarding the performance outcomes per technique. Due to a wide variety of internal analyses, outcomes were not directly comparable, and therefore, the data extraction and data synthesis were difficult. Some studies just noted the optimal performance value achieved by the central model, while other studies compared a variety of techniques and noted various performance values for different subgroups, different metrics, and different time windows and with the addition of various technical improvements. A few authors discussed their ultimate results and mentioned that their model was better than literature, that is, ?traditional? or ?conventional,? attempts, which were not always clearly defined. We have attempted to follow the authors? description to avoid incorrect comparisons. However, some comparisons may have become vague or skewed during data synthesis. Nevertheless, we scoped the optimal AUROC for each study at the meta level."
660,The Use of Deep Learning and Machine Learning on Longitudinal Electronic Health Records for the Early Detection and Prevention of Diseases: Scoping Review,"Up until now, we have only discussed possible beneficial results of using ML and DL on EHRs. However, we cannot ignore the possible risks, obstacles, challenges, or issues. Multiple (systematic) reviews have summarized these well-known issues, challenges, and limitations regarding the application of ML and DL on EHRs [2,51,66,67]. Viewed generally across all studies, practical obstacles influence the scientific and clinical implementation process: ethical considerations, privacy guidelines, legal procedures, equity, and data protection and security [68]. Beyond these obstacles, existing predictions face limitations due to their reliance on the data. First, key issues of using EHRs are irregularity, heterogeneity, sparsity (eg, missing data), temporality, the lack of gold-standard labels, and the volume and quality of data [2,51,66,67]. Second, ML and DL models have limited transparency and interpretability, face domain complexity (vs engineering expertise), may include biases, and often lack external validation. It is not possible to assign specific issues to specific studies; they all suffer more or less from the aforementioned issues. Our point is to become aware of the downside as well. Therefore, all our principal findings must be interpreted with this last discussion point in mind. In our opinion, a consistent, reliable, and valid way of EHR registration will improve the (use of) data and could be the first step toward a data-based health care system. This need for movement and improvement is important not only for research but also for practical convenience for clinicians and, consequently, to succeed in improving health outcomes."
661,The Use of Deep Learning and Machine Learning on Longitudinal Electronic Health Records for the Early Detection and Prevention of Diseases: Scoping Review,"The third research question of this review was to determine the scope of medical insights that could be generated. Our results showed that, with the development and training of ML and DL models on EHRs, (1) a high diagnostic accuracy was reached, (2) the most responsible predictors could be identified, (3) diseases could be detected earlier than when they are currently diagnosed, and (4) additional health care indicators were created. The most prominent medical insight was the detection performance of the models. However, how good the performance should be is ambiguous. For example, DL models used to facilitate earlier cancer diagnoses had AUROC values ranging from 0.55 to 0.99 [54], indicating performance from almost random guessing to near-perfect detection. Looking into a more mature domain, the diagnostic accuracy of sepsis predictions ranged from between 0.68 and 0.99 in the intensive care unit to between 0.96 and 0.98 in hospital and between 0.87 and 0.97 in the emergency department [55]. This metric is ideally as high as possible because it induces a high sensitivity (true positives) and specificity (true negatives). For comparison, the diagnostic accuracy of a gut feeling (meta-analysis on cancer diagnosis) had a sensitivity of only 0.40 and a specificity of 0.85 [56]. The diagnostic accuracy of physical examination (for the detection of cirrhosis) had a sensitivity between 0.15 and 0.68 and a specificity between 0.75 and 0.98 [57]. If ML can increase both the sensitivity and specificity of disease detection, nonhealthy persons can be found, and delayed diagnoses can be reduced without overtreating healthy persons misdiagnosed as cases [58]. If the developed model is further evaluated in false-negative and false-positive groups, it may be possible that the model detects even more (true) cases than those registered by clinicians. This is already the case for many DL techniques on imaging data [59]. For now, an even more important finding is the ability of some models to detect disease manifestation earlier than the moment of diagnosis registration in EHRs. These examples of earlier detection are aligned with a study on the onset of diseases [60] that concluded that ?slowly progressive diseases are often misperceived as relatively new? (ie, the onset could have been detected earlier). They found that, in 31% of diagnosed cases, the onset of their disease had started >1 year before their diagnosis. When disease predictions are early and accurate enough, it can facilitate disease prevention [23]. Especially with the addition of personally responsible factors and the biggest changers in risk prediction, prevention interventions may be more effective because they are more targeted to the individual. When medical prevention and interventions become based on the unique profile of each individual, personalized health care is delivered [61]. After all, the aforementioned medical insights only show the bright side of ML and DL models."
662,The Use of Deep Learning and Machine Learning on Longitudinal Electronic Health Records for the Early Detection and Prevention of Diseases: Scoping Review,"The first research question in this study sought to determine which diseases have been detected in longitudinal EHRs using ML techniques. Results showed that a variety of diseases could be detected or predicted, particularly diabetes; kidney diseases; diseases of the circulatory system; and mental, behavioral, and neurodevelopmental disorders [22]. Comparing our findings with those of prior work, only a third of EHR prediction models predict diseases; meanwhile, mortality and hospitalization remain the most prevalent outcomes [51]. Among the studies that have predicted diseases, cancer is the most frequently predicted disease based on EHRs. Another systematic review used clinical notes to identify chronic diseases [52]. It also found diseases of the circulatory system as the most prevalent and explained this by the structure of the data. Not only the structure but also the length of the EHR horizon before diagnosis may explain the diseases that can be detected or predicted. As we determined the scope of diseases that may be prevented, the length of historic data before the diagnosis (in existence of early signs) reflects the ?preventive stage? before the onset of the disease. The literature confirms that the longest EHR time horizon (8-10 years) has been found for diabetes and cardiovascular and kidney diseases [51], which were also prevalent diseases in our scoping review. In the end, the diseases that can be detected rely on available EHR data and, therefore, previous medical visits."
663,The Use of Deep Learning and Machine Learning on Longitudinal Electronic Health Records for the Early Detection and Prevention of Diseases: Scoping Review,"In 25% (5/20) of the studies, ML models were used to support (preliminary) screening on longitudinal EHRs [29,35,36,42,46]. After developing ML and DL models, risk classes could be generated as a precursor for physical screening. Approximately 90% of the diagnosed cases were concentrated in the highest (10%) risk class. Other studies assessed the utility of ML and DL models by thresholds for the proportion needed to be screened versus the detection possibility [29,42]. For example, to detect 90% of all validated patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, the highest 66% of risk scores (predicted by a DL model) needed to be screened, whereas to detect 80% of all cases, screening from only the highest 51% of risk scores was required [29]. Chauhan et al [42] reasoned the other way around and focused on efficiency. From the 10% highest risk scores for kidney failure, the positive predictive value was 68%. Moreover, the cost benefits for screening options using DL on EHRs were investigated [35]. Disease detection using a DL model was associated with a positive net benefit?to?cost benefit ratio for a single-point risk assessment (1:3) and continuous-time risk assessment (1:16). Reasons for preliminary screening in EHRs were to prioritize those with the highest risk for disciplines with long waiting lists [29,42], before costly or more invasive examinations (eg, image or biomechanical retrieval) [35,41], or to detect cases that might be missed by the current pathway and go undetected [35,36,46]."
664,The Use of Deep Learning and Machine Learning on Longitudinal Electronic Health Records for the Early Detection and Prevention of Diseases: Scoping Review,"Another way to support disease detection and prevention was by generating insights into factors, topics, predictors, or indicators contributing to disease prediction [30,31,33,35-41,43-46]. In unstructured clinical notes, relevant topics, related words, and medical concepts were found that contributed to disease detection [36,44]. These words concerned daily living, behavior, and medical history. ML and DL models using structured EHRs generated the most contributing factors and their individual contribution to the outcome [30,31,33,35,37-41,43,45,46]. The most contributing predictors reported among all disease categories were (related to) age, blood pressure, BMI, cholesterol, smoking, and specific medication. Concerning mental, behavioral, and neurodevelopmental disorders, additional predictors were related to depression, personal difficulties, and personality changes. Some of these identified predictors were new for their discipline (eg, specific medication) [35,41,44] or not yet incorporated into gold standards for clinical diagnostic guidelines (eg, genetic information) [40]. In addition to this, insights into the importance of (known) predictors were generated. For example, Raket et al [35] identified what factors were responsible for the biggest positive and negative change in risk estimation (eg, differential white blood cells) and, therefore, indicated the most effective targets for preventive interventions. Other models found that the contribution of some predictors was not as high as assumed (eg, stress on diabetes) [31]; factors that seemed individually irrelevant turned out to have cumulative important predictive value [35], and the instability of factors, not the factor itself, was a predictor for one disease [40]. The aforementioned factors were identified during model development, but applying such a model to new EHRs would generate responsible factors for that individual."
665,The Use of Deep Learning and Machine Learning on Longitudinal Electronic Health Records for the Early Detection and Prevention of Diseases: Scoping Review,"The use of ML and DL models on EHRs could support the detection of diseases with a high diagnostic accuracy. Performance metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity (recall), specificity, accuracy, precision, and the area under the precision-recall curve evaluated the detecting ability of the model. The AUROC was by far the most frequently reported metric because it illustrates the diagnostic ability for a binary classification (disease or nondisease) by using the sensitivity versus the specificity. Although it is not our intention to identify the best-performing model, it was observed that the AUROC of central models varied between 0.73 and 0.97. In 40% (8/20) of the studies, the optimal model had a ?good? detection (AUROC between 0.7 and 0.8), 35% (7/20) of the studies succeeded in having a ?very good? detection (AUROC between 0.8 and 0.9), and 15% (3/20) of the studies reached an ?excellent? detecting performance (AUROC between 0.9 and 1.0) [36,41,46] according to the classification of diagnostic accuracy by Simundic [50]. For the best disease detection, multiple models were compared within the study, or the central model was compared with existing detection tools. The authors of 30% (6/20) of the studies claimed that their model produced a (slightly) higher performance than ?conventional? or ?traditional? models or ML models in the literature [29,34,37,38,44,45]. In 15% (3/20) of the studies, the central model performed better compared with currently used approaches such as a validated clinical model [42], a surveillance tool on which current health indexes are based [47], and a gold standard in routine clinical practice according to the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association [40]. In one study, the prediction scores of the model were validated by experts who agreed 100% through manual record reviewing [36]. The diagnostic accuracy of the included models was not dependent on disease categories but relied on the EHR data given to the model. Many studies (7/20, 35%) mentioned that diseases could be detected more accurately (ie, the predictive performance was increased) when the EHRs were closer to the date of diagnosis [32,33,46] and with an increase in the number of predictors [37,40,43,48]. Overall, the ability of the included models to classify nonhealthy and healthy individuals was close to the registered diagnoses in the EHRs."
666,The Use of Deep Learning and Machine Learning on Longitudinal Electronic Health Records for the Early Detection and Prevention of Diseases: Scoping Review,"The EHRs of patients used in the included studies were originally recorded in hospitals or primary care centers. Especially for the detection of mental and behavioral disorders, EHRs were often extracted from military health records [32,36], and for neurodevelopmental and cardiovascular disorders, EHRs were mostly extracted from general practices [33,37]. Most studies (16/20, 80%) used structured EHRs [29-33,35,38-43,45-48], sometimes combined with unstructured data [34,36,37,44], to estimate the risk of a disease or medical event. Demographic information (statically used), symptoms, laboratory (blood) test results, diagnoses, medications, BMI, and clinical notes were commonly used data from EHRs. In addition, the EHR length and hospital admission and visit history were frequently added to the model. Lifestyle data were included for cardiovascular diseases. Clinical and social signs were more frequently used for self-harm and mental, behavioral, and neurodevelopmental disorders. For the prediction of kidney and diabetes outcomes, laboratory test results were frequently extracted. If EHRs were unstructured, natural language processing methods were conducted as a precursor to analyze clinical notes. The central techniques were a basic recurrent neural network (RNN) or long short-term memory (LSTM) [29,31,34,35,39,44,45,49], often compared with logistic regression, support vector machine, or random forest. When techniques were used that could not handle temporal data, a temporal aspect was created in the data. Although not extensively specified, a slope and intercept of variables [31,36]; a mean [30]; minimum, maximum, median, and SD measures [42]; the addition of a time-weight (eg, 0.9 ? days from reference point+decay) [43]; different time stamps [42]; or dividing the data into time blocks [33,46] were used.�Multimedia Appendix 3�[29-48] provides an overview of the EHR data used and the techniques applied."

After removing duplicates of references that were selected from >1 database, 483 (54%) of the references remained. By screening titles and abstracts, 426 (88.2%) of the articles were excluded. Of the remaining 57 articles, 2 (4%) could not be retrieved because they contained unpublished work. In the second phase, 55 full texts were reviewed for eligibility, and ultimately, 20 (36%) articles were included. Reports were mostly excluded due to wrong data, a technical focus, the absence of a longitudinal aspect, or models based on N<1000. No additional studies were found by checking reference lists. After the final screening, most included articles (18/20, 90%) were found in PubMed. The flowchart of the search and selection process is presented in�Figure 1."
668,The Use of Deep Learning and Machine Learning on Longitudinal Electronic Health Records for the Early Detection and Prevention of Diseases: Scoping Review,"Data were extracted from the papers included in the scoping review by 2 independent reviewers (LS and FCB) using a data extraction form developed in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp). This form was composed based on full-text findings relevant to the research question and was discussed by the research team. The data extraction sheet captured details about study characteristics, health care discipline, generated medical insights, and clinical benefits for health care and the way EHRs were processed temporally.�Multimedia Appendix 2�provides the list and definitions of all data items. This form was piloted using the first 5 articles and was revised and slightly adjusted during the process of extracting data. The extraction of ML techniques was modified to include the extraction of all techniques that were internally compared by appointing the central model and the comparison. Any disagreements between the reviewers were resolved through discussion with additional reviewers. Authors were contacted to request missing or additional data where required."
669,The Use of Deep Learning and Machine Learning on Longitudinal Electronic Health Records for the Early Detection and Prevention of Diseases: Scoping Review,"After several preliminary searches, 5 bibliographic databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science Core Collection [Clarivate Analytics], IEEE Xplore Digital Library, and computer science bibliography) were searched for relevant literature from inception to April 28, 2022. Searches were devised in collaboration with a medical information specialist (KAZ). The following search terms, including synonyms, closely related words, and keywords, were used as index terms or free-text words: ?neural network,? ?electronic medical record,? and ?prediction.? We used only search terms capturing specific ML techniques that are able to predict or classify. The search strategy was adapted for each included database or information source. The searches contained no methodological search filter or date or language restrictions that would limit results to specific study designs, dates, or languages. We searched computer science bibliography for conference proceedings and hand searched meeting abstracts. Duplicate articles were excluded using the R package�ASYSD�(R Foundation for Statistical Computing), an automated deduplication tool [25], followed by manual deduplication in EndNote (version X20.0.3; Clarivate Analytics) by the medical information specialist (KAZ). The full search strategy used for each database is detailed in�Multimedia Appendix 1."
670,The Use of Deep Learning and Machine Learning on Longitudinal Electronic Health Records for the Early Detection and Prevention of Diseases: Scoping Review,"Because ML is data driven (instead of conventional models that are hypothesis driven), only predictions based on >1000 participants in total were considered eligible.

677,The Use of Deep Learning and Machine Learning on Longitudinal Electronic Health Records for the Early Detection and Prevention of Diseases: Scoping Review,"It is a loss of information if ML developments remain unknown in health care because of the technical perspective of most authors. Especially given that artificial intelligence (AI) is a black box, it is important to clarify the clinical benefits and additional medical insights that can be achieved through these techniques. Therefore, the aim of this review was to perform a scoping review of the evidence on how the use of ML on longitudinal EHRs can support the early detection and prevention of diseases. A preliminary search was conducted, and no current or underway systematic or scoping reviews on the topic were identified. Only 1 review on longitudinal EHRs has been conducted [2], but it focused on methodologies. This study will contribute to what is already known by scoping the substantive medical insights that ML models yield. Given the aim of this study, the following research questions were addressed:"
678,The Use of Deep Learning and Machine Learning on Longitudinal Electronic Health Records for the Early Detection and Prevention of Diseases: Scoping Review,"In the past 15 years, an explosion in the volume of data registered in EHR systems has occurred [4]. In 2012, the yearly increase in the volume of stored data was up to 150% for hospitals [5]. Not only the number of records continues to increase over time, but EHRs are also quite extensive because of large free texts [6]. Even though the completeness and correctness of EHRs have been found to be at a high level [7], the usability during medical visits lags behind due to this rising volume and variety of EHR data [8]. Consequently, it has even become an experienced usability issue for clinicians to review clinical results and health information from the past [9]. This is quite problematic as some clinicians spend, on average, 32.1% of their time on EHRs reviewing medical care and notes from the past [10]. The increasing EHR workload causes exhaustion and burnout among clinicians [11], negatively affecting the health care quality. This can result in diagnostic errors (missed, delayed, or incorrect diagnoses) because of missed signs [12] registered in the past. In 67.4% of the cases, missing the chief presenting symptoms in EHRs was the reason for missed diagnoses. Overall, meaningful health records have the potential to support risk assessment and early diagnosis, but the increasing amount of data hinder clinicians from using them to their full potential."
679,The Use of Deep Learning and Machine Learning on Longitudinal Electronic Health Records for the Early Detection and Prevention of Diseases: Scoping Review,"Longitudinal EHRs proved to be helpful for support in health care. Current ML models on EHRs can support the detection of diseases in terms of accuracy and offer preliminary screening benefits. Regarding the prevention of diseases, ML and specifically DL models can accurately predict or detect diseases earlier than current clinical diagnoses. Adding personally responsible factors allows targeted prevention interventions. While ML models based on textual EHRs are still in the developmental stage, they have high potential to support clinicians and the health care system and improve patient outcomes."
680,The Use of Deep Learning and Machine Learning on Longitudinal Electronic Health Records for the Early Detection and Prevention of Diseases: Scoping Review,"This study was conducted according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. A literature search was performed in 2022 in collaboration with a medical information specialist in the following databases: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate Analytics), and IEEE Xplore Digital Library and computer science bibliography. Studies were eligible when longitudinal EHRs were used that aimed for the early detection of disease via ML in a prevention context. Studies with a technical focus or using imaging or hospital admission data were beyond the scope of this review. Study screening and selection and data extraction were performed independently by 2 researchers."
681,The Use of Deep Learning and Machine Learning on Longitudinal Electronic Health Records for the Early Detection and Prevention of Diseases: Scoping Review,"Electronic health records (EHRs) contain patients? health information over time, including possible early indicators of disease. However, the increasing amount of data hinders clinicians from using them. There is accumulating evidence suggesting that machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) can assist clinicians in analyzing these large-scale EHRs, as algorithms thrive on high volumes of data. Although ML has become well developed, studies mainly focus on engineering but lack medical outcomes."
682,Novel therapeutic targets for major depressive disorder related to oxidative stress identified by integrative multi-omics and multi-trait study,"This study has several limitations. First, it is possible that differences in gene expression between MDD patients and controls reflect the influences of factors such as age, sex, smoking, medications, and other health conditions, which without consider in the subsequent MR analysis. Second, we only focused on the cis-regions of OS and MDD genes, despite the possibility that trans-eQTL SNPs (SNPs >5?Mb from the gene) may have a widespread impact on regulatory networks. In addition, the data we used in the MR analysis were based on a European population, so whether these findings equally apply to other racial or ethnic groups remains to be further validate. Finally, functional experiments are still needed to confirm the importance of these DEGs in MDD pathogenesis through OS-dependent or OS-independent pathways."
683,Novel therapeutic targets for major depressive disorder related to oxidative stress identified by integrative multi-omics and multi-trait study,"In contrast to MAPKs, few studies have examined the genetic association of�KCNE1�with MDD, although McCaffery and colleagues proposed that�KCNE1�was associated with longer-term changes in depressive symptoms [58]. The KCNE family proteins are regulatory subunits of voltage-gated K(+) channels [59], and are implicated in multiple arrhythmogenic cardiac myocardium diseases [60]. The�KCNE1�subunit regulates the neuronal membrane potential through modulation of K(+) channels, including KCNQ channels [61]. Further, the KCNQ channel modulator retigabine has been shown to improve depressive symptoms, suggesting therapeutic potential for MDD [62]. Another study also included�KCNE1�expression in a diagnostic model for MDD [63], although no causal association was suggested. In the current study, preliminary genomic analysis indicated that�KCNE1�was upregulated in MDD and positioned as a linker gene between MDD and OS, while according to SMR analysis,�KCNE1�upregulation increases the risk of MDD. We speculate that drugs targeting�KCNE1�could show therapeutic efficacy against MDD."
684,Novel therapeutic targets for major depressive disorder related to oxidative stress identified by integrative multi-omics and multi-trait study,"Neuroinflammation in strongly implicated in MDD as evidenced by elevated inflammatory marker concentrations, infiltrating immune cell numbers, and antibody titers [33]. These inflammatory processes both generate and are promoted by ROS and RNS (hence the OS?inflammation interaction is also known as ?evil twins of aging?), further implicating OS in MDD pathogenesis [34]. Elevated ROS production leads to GSH depletion, oxidative damage, and ultimately enhanced inflammation [35]. Excessive ROS can promote the expression of proinflammatory cytokines through several pathways, including activation of promoting protein-1 and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF?B), increased histone acetylation, and activation of caspase-1 and NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3 [36?38]. Inflammatory reactions induce expression and release of peroxiredoxin 2, which in turn stimulates macrophages to release pro-inflammatory tumor necrosis factor-� (TNF-�) [39]. Elevated TNF-� had been detected in serum and in multiple brain subregions (including the anterior cingulate cortex, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus) of MDD patients [40,�41]. Neuroinflammation also promotes the kynurenine pathway and ensuing quinolinic acid generation by activating indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), and kynurenine 3-mono-oxygenase, which induces mitochondrial damage and results in further ROS production, glutamate release, N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor activation, Ca2+�influx, and mitochondrial calcium overload, the end result of which is loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced ATP generation, and accelerated ROS generation [36,�42,�43]. In addition, IDO and TDO activation may reduce 5-HT biosynthesis, and 5-HT insufficiency is widely believed to result in low mood [44]. These relationships also appear to be bidirectional, such that OS can promote neuroinflammation and vice versa in MDD. In accord with previous studies, we found that multiple immune-inflammatory gene pathways were activated in MDD compared to controls. These genes may in turn mediate the reciprocal exacerbation of OS generation and neuroinflammation leading to MDD. The OS?MDD crosstalk genes identified in this study are primarily involved in immune cell function, including activated CD8?+?T cells, effector memory CD8?+?T cells, regulatory T cells, type 1?T helper cells, eosinophils, macrophages, and monocytes, further supporting shared immune-inflammatory mechanisms in OS and MDD."
685,Novel therapeutic targets for major depressive disorder related to oxidative stress identified by integrative multi-omics and multi-trait study,"The F-statistic of all SNPs included in the analysis ranged from 29.855 to 3394.048, indicating a powerful instrumental variable?exposure association (threshold set at 10) (Supplementary Table�7). Results of the HEIDI test further suggested that all observed associations were not due to linkage (P�value?>?0.01)."
686,Novel therapeutic targets for major depressive disorder related to oxidative stress identified by integrative multi-omics and multi-trait study,"Immune cell infiltration is a major driver of OS in the brain, suggesting an important contribution to OS-related MDD pathogenesis. We employed Cibersort analysis to calculate the infiltration status of 22 immune cells in the�GSE39653�dataset, and the relative abundance of each immune cell type was then compared by the Wilcoxon sign rank test (Fig.�8A). The CIBERSORT algorithm was also used to compare immune cell infiltration profiles between Cluster A and Cluster B. The results revealed that dendritic cells and activated mast cells were highly abundant in Cluster B (Fig.�8B), and that the relative abundances of most immune cell subsets differed between clusters (Fig.�8C). Moreover, the ssGSEA algorithm indicated greater infiltration of activated CD8?+?T cells, effector memory CD8?+?T cells, regulatory T cells, Type 1?T helper cell, eosinophils, macrophages, and monocytes in MDD samples of Cluster A (Fig.�9A) (P�values?<?0.05).

687,Novel therapeutic targets for major depressive disorder related to oxidative stress identified by integrative multi-omics and multi-trait study,"The physical, behavioral, and cognitive symptoms of MDD can vary substantially among patients, so we examined the potential functions of these 32 key genes in distinct MDD phenotypes by cluster analysis using ConsensusClusterPlus. This analysis yielded two patient clusters in the�GSE39653�dataset, Cluster A and Cluster B, based on DEG profiles (Fig.�8A). The slope of consistency index for different classifications (Fig.�7B) further confirmed that two was the optimal cluster number for this cohort, while the scree plot in Fig.�8C�revealed the inflection point for best classification.

689,Novel therapeutic targets for major depressive disorder related to oxidative stress identified by integrative multi-omics and multi-trait study,"The GEO datasets�GSE32280,�GSE39653, and�GSE98793�were combined using the R ?cbind ()? function and the batch bias mitigated using the R ?sva? package (see Fig.�2�and Supplementary Table�1). In total, 596 DEGs were identified between MDD patients and healthy controls (HCs) using Limma, including 294 upregulated genes and 302 downregulated genes in MDD. The magnitudes of differential expression for significant DEGs (P�value?<?0.05) are shown as a volcano map in Fig.�3A�and as a heatmap in Fig.�3B�and details in Supplementary Table�2. These DEGs were enriched in GO CC terms ?specific granule?, ?specific granule membrane?, ?secretory granule membrane?, ?specific granule lumen?, and ?tertiary granule?, BP terms ?receptor signaling pathway via JAK-STAT and STAT?, ?placenta development?, and ?carbohydrate catabolic process?, and MF terms ?identical protein binding?, ?immune receptor activity?, ?cytokine receptor activity?, ?phospholipase activity?, and ?1-phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase regulator activity?

690,Novel therapeutic targets for major depressive disorder related to oxidative stress identified by integrative multi-omics and multi-trait study,"Causal inferences between GWAS and cis-eQTLs were evaluated using the SMR multi-tool. The top associated cis-QTLs were selected by considering a window centered around the corresponding gene (?�?1000?kb) and surpassing a�P�value threshold of 5.0???10?8. All SNPs with allele frequency differences larger than the specified threshold (0.2 in the current study) between datasets, including the linkage disequilibrium (LD) reference sample, the QTL summary data, and the outcome summary data, were excluded. All SMR analysis were implemented using SMR v1.3.1 and included SNPs as instruments, key genes for MDD?OS interactions as exposures, and MDD as the outcome (SMR�P�values?<?0.05, cis-eQTLs, and GWAS�P�values?<?1???10-5). The MR method was based on the following crucial assumptions: (1) instrumental variables had to be strongly associated with exposure (e.g., key genes for MDD?OS interactions); (2) instrumental variables influence the risk of outcome (e.g., MDD) only through their effects on exposure (e.g., key genes for MDD?OS interactions) risk, and (3) instrumental variables are independent of confounders. To ensure independency, the PLINK clumping method was used for clumping and was based on the European 1000 Genomes, as a LD reference panel. We then calculated F-statistics, which were used to assess for weak instrumental variable bias. F?<?10 indicated that instrumental variables subjected to weaker instrumental variable bias were poor. We then removed them to avoid affecting the results. Causality was deemed significant based on the�P�value <?0.05."
691,Novel therapeutic targets for major depressive disorder related to oxidative stress identified by integrative multi-omics and multi-trait study,"We gathered genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics of 170,756 MDD cases and 329,443 controls (8,483,301 genetic variants in total) from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (https://www.med.unc.edu/pgc), one of the largest, most innovative, and productive platforms in psychiatry [30]. The diagnostic criteria for MDD were described in detail in the source data. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) were selected as instrumental variables (IVs) to infer direct causal effects of gene expression or protein levels on MDD. Whole-blood eQTL summary statistics for 15,882 genes were obtained from 31,684 individuals in the eQTLGen database [31]. The current study focused only on cis-eQTLs within 1-Mb from the start or end of the gene."
692,Novel therapeutic targets for major depressive disorder related to oxidative stress identified by integrative multi-omics and multi-trait study,"The R ConsensusClusterPlus package was used to identify subpopulations with distinct molecular phenotypes based on hub genes for MDD?OS interactions [28]. Principal co-ordinates analysis (PCoA) was then conducted to verify consistency of clustering. The R package ggpubr was used to draw box plots with sample cluster labels as groups, and the differences between groups were evaluated for statistical significance by the Wilcoxon rank sum test."
693,Novel therapeutic targets for major depressive disorder related to oxidative stress identified by integrative multi-omics and multi-trait study,"Based on these analyses, we constructed a nomogram based on the�GSE39653�dataset using the R package rms. A nomogram model was then constructed based on the hub genes to predict the prevalence of OS-associated MDD. Calibration curve analysis was performed to evaluate the accuracy and resolution of the nomogram. Finally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to evaluate the accuracy of the diagnostic model for the onset of OS-associated MDD using the R package pROC. Thorough composition validation techniques were employed to confirm model performance for distinguishing MDD from control samples."
694,Novel therapeutic targets for major depressive disorder related to oxidative stress identified by integrative multi-omics and multi-trait study,"To reveal biological relationships among key genes and gene clusters related to OS and MDD, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was conducted using the R package clusterProfiler. Genes were assessed for molecular function (MF), cell component (CC), and biological process (BP) annotations with a False Discovery Rate (FDR)-corrected�P�values?<?0.05 considered statistically significant. The R package cowplot was then used to conduct Spearman correlation analyses between key OS- and MDD-related genes as well as to draw heat maps, scatter plots, and correlation curves. Again,�P�value?<?0.05 was considered statistically significant. Key genes were then mapped to chromosomal locations using the R package RCircos based on data from the R package and downloaded from the ENSEMBL database. The open-source STRING database was then used to build a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network [27], which was subsequently visualized using Cytoscape."

These standardized gene expression data formed the basis for all further analysis. To analyze the effect of OS-related gene expression level on MDD risk, the R limma package was used to identify DEGs between disease and normal control samples, with the absolution value of log2-fold change (log2FC)?>?1 and�P�value?<?0.05 set as thresholds. These DEGs were visualized by volcano plot and a heat map was constructed using the R packages heatmaps (version 1.0.12) and ggplot2 (version 3.3.2)."
696,Novel therapeutic targets for major depressive disorder related to oxidative stress identified by integrative multi-omics and multi-trait study,"To address this issue, we conducted a comprehensive multi-omics analysis of the association between OS and MDD and identified multiple differentially expressed genes (DEGs) linking the two conditions. Machine learning models trained using these DEGs reliably distinguished patients from controls in an independent dataset. Thus, these genes may serve as feasible biomarkers or treatment targets. Furthermore, we utilized a multi-omics summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) approach to identify putative causal OS-related genes for MDD."
697,Novel therapeutic targets for major depressive disorder related to oxidative stress identified by integrative multi-omics and multi-trait study,"Cellular metabolism and various signaling mechanisms result in the formation of highly reactive free radicals, including reactive oxygen species (OS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Under normal physiological conditions, these species are neutralized by endogenous antioxidants; however, an imbalance between ROS or RNS production and scavenging will result in oxidative stress (OS), which leads to the oxidative damage of cellular lipids, proteins, and genomic DNA [8], while severe OS can trigger necrotic or apoptotic cell death. Oxidative stress and ensuing cell death is strongly implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as the Alzheimer?s disease and Parkinson?s disease [9,�10], and recent studies have suggested that OS also contributes to the pathophysiology and treatment response of MDD [11,�12]. For instance, a positive correlation was found between and the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in key MDD-associated brain regions, such as the thalamus, anterior cingulate gyrus, and superior frontal gyrus, and plasma concentrations of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione reductase [13]. Furthermore, depression severity and working memory impairment were associated with higher plasma concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA), an indicator of lipid peroxidation from oxidative stress, among recurrent MDD patients both before and after antidepressant treatment [14]. Reduced SOD activity, lower levels of the non-enzyme antioxidant glutathione (GSH), and elevated lipid peroxidation products have been proposed as reliable biomarkers for MDD [15,�16]. In experiment animals as well, chronic unpredictable mild stress can induce depression-like symptoms and concomitant abnormalities in redox balance across brain subregions, including decreased GSH and SOD activities and higher levels of ROS, MDA, and carbonyl in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus [17]. Despite a growing number of studies implicating OS in MDD, there are still discrepancies [11,�18]. An early meta-analysis of 23 studies with 4980 individuals found increased OS among MDD patients compared to matched individuals without depression, but some included studies found lower antioxidant biomarker concentrations (MDA and 8-oxo-2?-deoxyguanosine) in MDD [19]. A recent meta-analysis also concluded that OS status was more severe in MDD, but found no significant differences in catalase, SOD, glutathione peroxidase, and uric acid between MDD patients and healthy controls [20]."
698,Novel therapeutic targets for major depressive disorder related to oxidative stress identified by integrative multi-omics and multi-trait study,"Oxidative stress (OS) is strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) but the molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. The purpose of this study is to identify genes related to both OS and MDD, and further to evaluate the utility of these genes as diagnostic markers and potential treatment targets. We searched datasets related to MDD from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) also related to OS according to GeneCards. Bioinformatics analyses and machine learning algorithms were used to identify hub genes mediating OS?MDD interactions. A summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) approach was employed to identify possible causal genes for MDD from blood tissue eQLT data. These investigations identified 32 genes mediating OS?MDD interactions, while SMR analysis identified�KCNE1�(OR?=?1.057, 95%CI?=?1.013?1.102,�P�value?=?0.010),�MAPK3�(OR?=?1.023, 95%CI?=?1.004?1.043,�P�value?=?0.020), and�STIP1�(OR?=?0.792, 95%CI?=?0.641?0.979,�P�value?=?0.031) as OS-related causal genes for MDD. These genes may thus serve as useful diagnostic markers and potential therapeutic targets."

They delve into the intricacies of maternal health, not just at a superficial level but by peeling back the layers to expose the profound implications on mental and physical well-being. These articles are a testament to the evolving nature of healthcare, urging us to reevaluate and recalibrate our approach to women?s health. While strides have indeed been made in the field of women?s health, there remain expanses of uncharted territory. These articles, collectively, serve as a compass, directing our attention to the areas around the globe and the topics where knowledge is sparse and where further quality research is needed. It is a call to action for the scientific community, urging them to contribute to a deeper understanding of women?s health."
700,Maternal Health Considerations: Highlighting and advancing opportunities for improved maternal health,"Physical inactivity and other risk factors were investigated by Fondjo et al.�29�in the pursuit of understanding postpartum preeclampsia. Postpartum preeclampsia poses significant risks globally, including hospital readmissions and maternal complications. Understanding its risk factors is crucial for prevention and management strategies. This case-control study, conducted in Ghana, aimed to identify such factors. Among 65 postpartum preeclamptic women and 65 normotensive mothers, physical inactivity, infrequent antenatal visits, analgesic use, and caesarean delivery were significantly associated with both new-onset and persistent postpartum preeclampsia. Contraceptive use was linked to new-onset cases, while low-birthweight babies increased the risk of persistent preeclampsia. The findings underscore the importance of screening, close monitoring, and follow-up care post-delivery to manage postpartum preeclampsia effectively."
701,Maternal Health Considerations: Highlighting and advancing opportunities for improved maternal health,"In a separate Australian cohort, research by Beetham et al.�27�used a longitudinal study design and evaluated physical activity and maternal and infant outcomes. Conducted with 1657 pregnant women aged 28?39 years, participants reported their physical activity levels in each trimester and completed surveys regarding pregnancy and childbirth outcomes within 3 years post-birth. Physical activity levels were classified by frequency and described by categories of ?Nil?, ?Low?, ?Moderate?, and ?High?. The study found no significant association between physical activity during pregnancy and infant birthweight, prematurity, gestational diabetes, hypertension, or antenatal depression. However, there was a lower prevalence of antenatal anxiety among women with low or moderate physical activity levels compared to those with no activity. These findings suggest that while different volumes of physical activity during pregnancy did not impact measured adverse health outcomes, engaging in low to moderate physical activity may contribute to reducing antenatal anxiety."
702,Maternal Health Considerations: Highlighting and advancing opportunities for improved maternal health,"Cardiometabolic markers and placenta status were the feature from the Spanish research team investigating foetal sex in a sample of over 100 women.�25�This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate variances in maternal-neonatal metabolic markers and placental status based on foetal sex among Caucasian pregnant women and their newborns. Analysis of serum cardiometabolic markers revealed that mothers carrying male foetuses exhibited higher triglyceride levels during late pregnancy, while male newborns had greater levels of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol compared to females. Furthermore, mothers of male infants and male newborns had higher uric acid levels at birth. Placentas from female infants showed higher placental-newborn weight ratios, manganese content, and fibroblast growth factor-2, with slightly longer telomeres. Despite these subtle differences, the study suggests the potential for a more personalised approach to prenatal care based on foetal sex, considering the observed variations in cardiometabolic markers and placental status."
703,Maternal Health Considerations: Highlighting and advancing opportunities for improved maternal health,"Of timely concern was the work produced by Ross et al.�23�in which the psychological impact of COVID-19 testing was evaluated in a Canadian context. Incredible disruption was made throughout the healthcare system to respond to the coronavirus outbreak and subsequent variants of concern internationally. These anecdotal and documented public health measures included routine testing to enable access to hospitals and the admission of birth partners and supports were heavily scrutinised at one of the most vulnerable times in a woman?s life. Ross et al.�23�further describe the concern of infecting others and how that stress and strain were also among healthcare workers in obstetrics as well. While it was an important step in maintaining health, it may have amplified an already stressful time in the lives of those involved. Obstetric patients expressed concerns about transmitting COVID-19 to their newborns and partners but reported relief and support from the testing programme. They also believed the testing initiative helped reduce anxiety and contributed to research benefitting others. Healthcare workers experienced increased job stress during the pandemic, with the testing programme causing minor additional stress, particularly among nurses. However, the majority of healthcare workers viewed the testing initiative positively and valuable for research purposes. Overall, the study suggests that universal SARS-CoV-2 testing can be beneficial in estimating COVID-19 prevalence without significantly increasing stress levels among patients and healthcare workers."
704,Maternal Health Considerations: Highlighting and advancing opportunities for improved maternal health,"Aligned with the breast cancer theme was another Australian protocol looking at a comprehensive randomised controlled trial investigating nurse-led Tai Chi aimed at improving a range of mental health and well-being outcomes along with physical functioning in women with breast cancer by Wang et al.�21�This protocol outlines an interventional trial aiming to assess the therapeutic effects of a Tai Chi programme on breast cancer management. The study will involve 40 participants diagnosed with breast cancer, randomised into either a Tai Chi programme or a waiting list control group. The Tai Chi programme will consist of 12 weeks of group sessions held twice a week, focusing on improving mental well-being, physical function, and quality of life. Primary outcomes include potential enhancements in quality of life, while secondary outcomes encompass improvements in mental well-being and physical function, assessed through self-administered online assessments and physical examinations. If successful, this research could highlight Tai Chi as a safe and effective exercise for empowering breast cancer patients in self-management and improving their overall well-being, with findings disseminated through various channels to inform both patients and healthcare professionals. Of note, pregnancy and/or history of pregnancy are not explicitly inclusive or exclusive criteria which would lend itself well to considerations around breast cancer and maternal health more generally."
705,Maternal Health Considerations: Highlighting and advancing opportunities for improved maternal health,"Another article about child feeding practices and malnutrition in rural Malaysia was explored by Chee Din et al.�19�in a case-control methodology in a cohort of just over 100 participants. The researchers investigated the association between child feeding practices, maternal depression, and malnutrition among young children in a rural Malaysian community. Structured questionnaires were administered to Malay mothers of malnourished children and mothers of well-nourished children. The findings revealed that depressed mothers ceased exclusive breastfeeding earlier than non-depressed mothers. Binary logistic regression analysis indicated that maternal depression significantly increased the risk of child malnutrition, with each additional child in the family further elevating this risk. The study underscores the importance of early screening for maternal depression, potentially during the first trimester, to mitigate the risk of child malnutrition by addressing associated feeding practices and maternal mental health."
706,Maternal Health Considerations: Highlighting and advancing opportunities for improved maternal health,"Postpartum depression is a recognised public health challenge, and in particular for mothers living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). As Yeboa et al.�18�explain, the diagnosis impacts upon their engagement in care, HIV disease progression, and elevates the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. A cross-sectional quantitative research design was utilised to evaluate nearly 300 participants in Uganda. Yeboa et al.�18�noted that postpartum depression had a prevalence of 15.9% in their examined cohort. After adjusting for other variables, participants also reported inadequate male partner support which was significantly more likely to indicate the woman experienced postpartum depression compared to those with sufficient support. The findings underscore the importance of routinely assessing mothers living with HIV for depression and the crucial role of male partner support. Healthcare providers for HIV-infected women should devise strategies to promote such support, contributing to enhanced maternal, infant, and HIV treatment outcomes."
707,Maternal Health Considerations: Highlighting and advancing opportunities for improved maternal health,"In the wake of the global pandemic, uncertainty has prompted reflections on our priorities. The surge of ?lockdown? babies1,2�underscores the closeness forged during challenging times, juxtaposed against the deliberative decisions to defer or postpone family planning. In light of these circumstances, an intensified focus on maternal health research is certainly warranted. The landscape is evolving rapidly, marked by unprecedented strides in fertility treatments, a growing trend of women choosing to delay pregnancy, and an increasing awareness of holistic health considerations.3�?5�It is imperative that we propel maternal health to the forefront of our collective consciousness, transcending disciplinary boundaries and permeating diverse sectors such as exercise physiology, obstetrics/gynaecology, psychology, nutrition/dietetics, telehealth, and public health interventions.6�?8"
708,"Camouflaging, internalized stigma, and mental health in the general population","Camouflaging/IM is associated with adverse mental health outcomes in the general population that parallel those observed previously in autistic people, providing empirical support for the transactional IM framework (Ai et al., 2022). The impacts of camouflaging/IM on mental health are nuanced; women experience more significant repercussions from camouflaging/IM compared to men, and autistic and ADHD traits differentially moderate the associations between camouflaging/IM and mental health. Camouflaging/IM is likely driven by internalized stigma through social anxiety, yet this form of stigma management likely still leads to poorer mental health. Future research should clarify these individual differences and mechanistic relations using longitudinal and developmental approaches."
709,"Camouflaging, internalized stigma, and mental health in the general population","We did not sufficiently assess positive outcomes of camouflaging/IM. Camouflaging/IM has been reported as a means of securing social benefits, employment, and quality of life by both autistic and neurotypical individuals (Field et al., 2024;�Leary & Kowalski, 1990;�Livingston et al., 2019;�Zhuang et al., 2023). Our study might have overlooked these co-existing positive outcomes. Lastly, we only measured self-reported camouflaging/IM engagement and intention but not its effectiveness in daily life. Camouflaging intent, efforts, and effectiveness could differentially predict mental health (Field et al., 2024). Measures that quantify the effectiveness or capacity for camouflaging/IM, such as the self-monitoring scale (Lennox & Wolfe, 1984) or the discrepancy operationalization (Lai et al., 2017), could offer complementary information."
710,"Camouflaging, internalized stigma, and mental health in the general population","Internalized stigma correlated with negative mental health, with IM partially accounting for these associations. The mediation effects of IM were not influenced by gender nor neurodivergent traits. This reaffirms, across social and neurodiverse groups, the ubiquitous function of camouflaging/IM to manage internalized stigma and its associations with poorer mental health. This account is consistent with the minority stress model highlighting stigma as a primary stressor in marginalized groups (including neurodivergent people) that elevates mental health risks (Botha & Frost, 2020;�Meyer, 2010), as well as with findings on how IM across social groups and contexts leads to increased anxiety, depression, identity disturbance, and exhaustion (Mun & Kim, 2021;�Pachankis et al., 2020;�Sedlovskaya et al., 2013). The overlaps between the current general population findings and the prior IM literature support the conceptualization of camouflaging as part of IM. These new insights, nestled within the interactions among the social environment, IM, and mental health, underscore the need to address mental health ramifications of IM at their common root: alleviating internalized stigma."
711,"Camouflaging, internalized stigma, and mental health in the general population","Aligned with predictions of the transactional IM framework, camouflaging/IM is more psychologically adverse for individuals with higher autistic traits. The mechanisms could involve the compounded social stigma and unique cognitive processing demands associated with autistic traits in neurotypical-majority social contexts. Interestingly, we observed the opposite pattern with ADHD traits. Camouflaging and self-presentation in the context of ADHD traits might not involve the extensive re-learning of social skills or forced modifications across levels of behavior and cognition as those in the context of autistic traits; they might instead concern the prompt optimization of fit with particular contexts, and hence serve as efficient social coping strategies that benefit mental wellbeing. These novel contrasting findings highlight the heterogeneity among neurodivergent groups, and, potentially, neurodevelopmental diagnoses. Research is needed to unpack camouflaging/IM efforts and outcomes in relation to ADHD and ADHD features, how they relate to autistic camouflaging findings, and the underlying reasons for the parallels or divergences (Canela et al., 2017;�Ginapp et al., 2023)."
712,"Camouflaging, internalized stigma, and mental health in the general population","The mental health ramifications of camouflaging in autistic individuals have received substantial attention lately (Field et al., 2024;�Zhuang et al., 2023). However, minimal understanding exists on the extent of these impacts across social-identity and neurodiverse groups. We showed that the mental health correlates of camouflaging and self-presentation in the general population largely overlap (Figure 3) and echoes previous studies and qualitative reports of autism-enriched samples (Zhuang et al., 2023). This continuity provides inferential evidence that camouflaging and self-presentation converge as IM experiences associated with poorer mental health across diverse human groups. Self-presentation was descriptively associated with fewer mental health outcomes when considering gender and neurodivergent-trait moderators (Figure 2). One explanation is that within the same IM umbrella phenomena, camouflaging might capture a specific class of IM that requires a greater extent of behavioral modification (e.g. changing how one behaves overall across social contexts rather than enacting one-off strategies), is more pervasive, and is more socially compelled than voluntary, thus leading to more varied and severe mental health repercussions (Ai et al., 2022)."
713,"Camouflaging, internalized stigma, and mental health in the general population","The mental health ramifications of camouflaging and self-presentation in the general population revealed nuanced differences by gender and neurodivergent characteristics (Figure 2). Women, more so than men, who reported greater camouflaging exhibited greater anxiety, lower mental wellbeing, and greater self-regulatory fatigue. Individuals with elevated autistic traits and increased camouflaging reported greater anxiety and depression symptoms, reduced mental wellbeing, and increased self-regulatory fatigue, whereas those with elevated ADHD traits with increased camouflaging particularly reported more�positive�outcomes, including increased mental wellbeing, reduced self-regulatory fatigue, and greater subjective authenticity. When the same analyses were repeated with self-presentation, we found the same directionality of results, also significantly moderated by gender and neurodivergent traits. In sum, increased camouflaging and self-presentation both correlated with poorer mental health more so for women than men and for those with higher than lower autistic traits; yet both were associated with better mental health outcomes in those with higher than lower ADHD traits."
714,"Camouflaging, internalized stigma, and mental health in the general population","For simple mediation (Figure 3a), social anxiety partially mediated the link between internalized stigma and increased IM. Further, IM partially mediated the links between internalized stigma and increased generalized anxiety, increased depression, increased self-regulatory fatigue, and reduced authenticity."
715,"Camouflaging, internalized stigma, and mental health in the general population","For camouflaging, the analysis of variance model comparisons test deemed the step 3 model as most optimal (Figure 2a,�Table 2,�Supplemental Table SM.3). Increased camouflaging significantly predicted better mental wellbeing and reduced subjective authenticity. Women who engaged in greater camouflaging reported greater anxiety, reduced mental wellbeing, and greater self-regulatory fatigue than men who engaged in greater camouflaging. With increased levels of autistic traits, increased camouflaging predicted greater generalized anxiety, greater depression, reduced mental wellbeing, and greater self-regulatory fatigue. With increased levels of ADHD traits, increased camouflaging predicted increased mental wellbeing, reduced self-regulatory fatigue, and increased subjective authenticity."
716,"Camouflaging, internalized stigma, and mental health in the general population","We used mediation modeling to assess the theoretical mechanistic relationships among internalized stigma, social anxiety, camouflaging/IM, and mental health. Given the high internal consistency observed across CAT-Q and SPT items at �?=?0.968 (95% CI [0.965, 0.971]), the standardized total scores from these two scales were averaged as a composite score to parsimoniously represent IM. The two total scores were averaged to ensure that the composite IM variable is equally weighted between the two scales of different item numbers. We used Hayes? PROCESS Model-4 (Hayes, 2013) to estimate the mediation effect of social anxiety between internalized stigma and IM, and then the mediation effects of IM between internalized stigma and mental health outcomes."
717,"Camouflaging, internalized stigma, and mental health in the general population","We used hierarchical multivariate regression to evaluate the mental health correlates of camouflaging and self-presentation, and examined the moderating effects of gender, autistic, and ADHD traits. The multivariate regression method was chosen due to significant correlations among the mental health variables (Supplemental Figure 1). All continuous variables were first standardized to�z-scores, and no variable showed notable skewness. Assumption of linearity was confirmed via visual inspection of the correlation scatterplots of all variables, and there was no evidence of multicollinearity as the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) values of all continuous predictors were less than 3. Normality of residuals was confirmed via visual inspection of the density and Q-Q plots. The Goldfeld-Quandt test suggested no heteroscedasticity in the data."
718,"Camouflaging, internalized stigma, and mental health in the general population","Measurements for the theoretical mental health ramifications of camouflaging/IM included: the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7;�Spitzer et al., 2006) for generalized anxiety symptoms, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9;�Kroenke et al., 2001) for depressive symptoms, the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (SWEMWS;�Stewart-Brown et al., 2009) for mental wellbeing, the Self-Regulatory Fatigue Scale Short Form (SRF-S;�Nes et al., 2013) for ego depletion and cognitive exhaustion, and the Kernis-Goldman Authenticity Inventory Short Form (KGAI;�Bond et al., 2018) for subjective authenticity."
719,"Camouflaging, internalized stigma, and mental health in the general population","Participants completed an online survey hosted on Qualtrics. This survey comprised self-reported measures of demographics information, camouflaging, self-presentation, neurodivergent traits, internalized stigma, and mental health. These scales demonstrate psychometric strengths and are theoretically relevant to the transactional IM framework (Ai et al., 2022). The Cronbach?s alphas for all measures in this sample were all above 0.70, indicating acceptable to excellent internal consistency. For psychometric details see�Supplemental Table SM.1."
720,"Camouflaging, internalized stigma, and mental health in the general population","The participants consist of 1,051 adults aged 18?years or older capable of self-reporting and consent. The sample size was the largest we could opt for given study feasibility. It satisfies sample size standards for participant-to-predictor ratio in hierarchical multivariate regression (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2001) and for moderated mediation analysis (Preacher et al., 2007), which are employed in this study. Recruitment occurred over 26?days via Prolific, an online crowdsourcing platform that allows its users to voluntarily participate in web-based studies for monetary compensation."
721,"Camouflaging, internalized stigma, and mental health in the general population","Another key mechanism theoretically linking camouflaging, stigma, and mental health is social anxiety. Camouflaging is associated with increased social anxiety in autistic and non-autistic people (Hull et al., 2021;�Lorenz & Hull, 2024), but it is unclear if this effect is unidirectional (Chapman et al., 2022). Social anxiety can arise from hostile environments and perpetuate more camouflaging as individuals strive to maintain their social performance (Bargiela et al., 2016;�Chapman et al., 2022). The transactional IM framework predicts a feedback loop (Ai et al., 2022), whereby heightened social anxiety, initially resulting from camouflaging/IM, sustains camouflaging/IM and exacerbates further psychological distress (Chapman et al., 2022). Hence, it is important to examine social anxiety as a mediator between internalized stigma and camouflaging/IM, and not just as an outcome of camouflaging/IM."
722,"Camouflaging, internalized stigma, and mental health in the general population","The transactional IM framework suggests stigma to be a key mechanistic factor linking camouflaging/IM, its social drivers, and mental health outcomes. Stigmatization refers to the discrediting of social-identity attributes that evoke alienation, discrimination, and victimization (Goffman, 1963). When people internalize the stigma, it can lead to shame and self-criticism, cascading to lower quality of life and elevated mental health problems (Drapalski et al., 2013;�Livingston & Boyd, 2010). Stigma management in marginalized groups exhausts psychological resources and evokes distress (Frost, 2011). In autistic individuals, internalized stigma is linked to poorer mental health (Botha & Frost, 2020;�Han et al., 2021;�den Houting et al., 2021), yet mitigating the stigma, a key driver of autistic camouflaging (Cage & Troxell-Whitman, 2019;�Pearson & Rose, 2021;�Perry et al., 2022), is also associated with psychological repercussions, possibly elevating mental health risks in autistic compared with non-autistic people (Lai, 2023)."
723,"Camouflaging, internalized stigma, and mental health in the general population","Sociodemographic and neurodivergent trait differences may moderate the psychological impacts of camouflaging/IM. For instance, autistic girls and women tend to experience greater social pressure from gendered expectations to socialize (Kreiser & White, 2014) than autistic boys and men and are thus more compelled to mask their autistic features (Cola et al., 2020;�Hull et al., 2019;�Lai et al., 2017,�2023). This might result in more distress, struggle in everyday functioning, and even suicidal ideation, although current findings are mixed (Beck et al., 2020;�Bernardin, Lewis, et al., 2021;�Hull et al., 2021). In the general population, however, men reported greater camouflaging than women (Ai et al., 2024). This opposite finding to that of autistic populations might be attributable in part to differences in the purposes and expressions of camouflaging. Existing IM research suggests that self-presentation strategies are more voluntarily employed by men for instrumental gains, and are more agentic, active, and varied in men compared to women (Bolino et al., 2016;�Guadagno & Cialdini, 2007). The burdens of camouflaging/IM in gender-diverse or non-binary autistic and non-autistic individuals are just gaining traction (McQuaid et al., 2022)."
724,"Camouflaging, internalized stigma, and mental health in the general population","Many aspects of camouflaging, including its mental health ramifications, are likely not solely present in autistic people (Ai et al., 2024;�Hull et al., 2019;�Livingston et al., 2020;�van der Putten et al., 2024). Camouflaging motivations and strategies in a large U.S. general population sample parallel those reported in autism-enriched samples (Ai et al., 2024), suggesting that camouflaging extends to alterations of behaviors and other social identity aspects that people generally enact in face of belonging needs or stigma (Chapman et al., 2022). Camouflaging outcomes also show continuity across populations. Both autistic and non-autistic individuals who engage in camouflaging experience depression, anxiety, and stress (Cassidy et al., 2020;�Hull et al., 2019;�Lorenz & Hull, 2024;�Miller et al., 2021;�Somerville et al., 2023). These findings echo the impression management (IM) literature, whereby emotional suppression, false self-presentation, and concealment of stigmatized traits are linked to elevated depression, anxiety, stress, and identity difficulties (Jeung et al., 2018;�Mun & Kim, 2021;�Pachankis et al., 2020;�Sedlovskaya et al., 2013). It is thus critical to investigate camouflaging, as a kind of IM, in the general population to expand our understanding of the socio-contextual underpinnings in how camouflaging arises and affects mental health."
725,"Camouflaging, internalized stigma, and mental health in the general population",These findings advance the conceptual clarity and clinical relevance of camouflaging and impression management across social and neurodiverse groups in the general population. The ramifications of camouflaging and impression management underscore the need to alleviate internalized stigma for better mental health across human groups.
726,"Camouflaging, internalized stigma, and mental health in the general population","Data were collected from 972 adults from a representative U.S. general population sample, with measures pertaining to camouflaging, impression management, mental health, internalized stigma, and neurodivergent traits. Multivariate hierarchical regression and moderated mediation analyses were used to address the two research aims."
727,"Camouflaging, internalized stigma, and mental health in the general population","Camouflaging, the strategies that some autistic people use to hide their differences, has been hypothesized to trigger mental health ramifications. Camouflaging might reflect ubiquitous impression management experiences that are not unique to autistic people and similarly impact the mental health of non-autistic people."

The large, comprehensive dataset and advanced analytical techniques employed provide robust insights into patterns and predictors of mental health outcomes in this underserved population. These findings have important implications for health policy and clinical practice, informing targeted interventions aimed at improving mental health equity and outcomes for African Americans. Furthermore, our study lays a foundation for future research, highlighting areas where more in-depth, longitudinal studies could further elucidate the complex factors influencing mental health disparities."
729,Predicting mental health disparities using machine learning for African Americans in Southeastern Virginia,"Fourthly, the geographic specificity of our dataset to Southeastern Virginia, while providing valuable local insights, limits the generalizability of our findings to other U.S. regions. Mental health disparities and their underlying factors may vary across different geographic and cultural contexts, necessitating caution when extrapolating our results to other populations."
730,Predicting mental health disparities using machine learning for African Americans in Southeastern Virginia,"Secondly, our reliance on retrospective, pre-existing hospital discharge data introduces potential biases related to data collection and documentation practices. This approach may lead to misclassification or underreporting of conditions, as we were unable to control the data collection process. Consequently, specific nuances and contextual factors that could influence mental health outcomes may have been overlooked. The retrospective nature of the data also limits our ability to establish causal relationships between the identified factors and mental health outcomes."
731,Predicting mental health disparities using machine learning for African Americans in Southeastern Virginia,"Firstly, The implementation of machine learning algorithms in mental health diagnostics presents distinct methodological challenges and limitations across different model architectures70. GB, while adept at handling complex interactions, requires meticulous tuning of critical hyperparameters, including learning rate, tree depth, and boosting iterations, to mitigate overfitting risks and optimize the bias-variance trade-off71. RF exhibits robustness against overfitting but demonstrates sensitivity to hyperparameters such as tree count and feature split threshold, potentially compromising computational efficiency and model interpretability in high-dimensional datasets72. ANNs present unique challenges in hyperparameter optimization, particularly in architecting optimal layer structures and selecting appropriate activation functions. Their performance significantly depends on training data quality and requires careful tuning of layer composition, neuron count, learning rate, and regularization parameters73. LR, while offering superior interpretability, faces limitations with non-linear relationships and necessitates precise feature selection and regularization parameter optimization to address multicollinearity concerns74,75. Naive Bayes classifiers, despite their computational efficiency, are constrained by their fundamental assumption of feature independence, which rarely holds in clinical settings. While requiring less intensive hyperparameter tuning, these models demand careful consideration of prior selection and zero-frequency handling76."
732,Predicting mental health disparities using machine learning for African Americans in Southeastern Virginia,"While we acknowledge the limitations inherent in our cross-sectional design, the strengths of our study significantly outweigh these constraints. The comprehensive nature of our dataset, coupled with advanced analytical techniques and a focus on an underserved population, positions our research as a valuable contribution to the field of mental health disparities. Our findings not only enhance the current understanding of mental health challenges among African Americans but also pave the way for future longitudinal studies that can build upon this foundation to examine causal relationships and long-term trends."
733,Predicting mental health disparities using machine learning for African Americans in Southeastern Virginia,"By exploring gender and age differences in mental health prevalence and readmission rates, our study highlights subgroups that may require tailored interventions. This granular analysis contributes to a more personalized approach to mental health care and policy development. Our findings have substantial implications for health policy, particularly in addressing healthcare disparities and improving mental health outcomes. The study provides evidence-based recommendations for targeted interventions, potentially influencing policy decisions to enhance healthcare access and equity for African Americans."

Efforts should be made to improve insurance coverage and access to mental health services, given the significant impact of insurance type on mental health outcomes and healthcare utilization."
736,Predicting mental health disparities using machine learning for African Americans in Southeastern Virginia,"1. Targeted screening and intervention programs should be developed, particularly for Mood Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, Schizotypal, and Delusional Disorders, which were found to be most prevalent."
737,Predicting mental health disparities using machine learning for African Americans in Southeastern Virginia,"In conclusion, our study contributes novel insights to mental health disparities research through its comprehensive analysis of mental health patterns, application of advanced machine learning techniques, and focus on an underserved population. These findings have the potential to inform targeted interventions and personalized care strategies, representing a significant step forward in addressing mental health disparities among African Americans in Southeastern Virginia and potentially in other underserved communities."
738,Predicting mental health disparities using machine learning for African Americans in Southeastern Virginia,"While our study focused on African Americans in Southeastern Virginia, the findings have broader implications. The higher prevalence of mental health disorders in our study population compared to national averages highlights potential disparities that may exist in other underserved communities. This emphasizes the importance of region-specific research and tailored interventions to address mental health disparities effectively."
739,Predicting mental health disparities using machine learning for African Americans in Southeastern Virginia,"In the broader literature, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests have emerged as leading classification methods61, while Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved superior accuracy in bipolar disorder diagnosis62?64. Gradient Boosting algorithms have demonstrated enhanced predictive capabilities through their iterative error-learning mechanisms65,66."

These computational tools enable personalized prediction of mental health outcomes, facilitating targeted interventions across diverse populations."
741,Predicting mental health disparities using machine learning for African Americans in Southeastern Virginia,"Key predictors of mental health outcomes identified in our study include gender, age, comorbidities, and insurance type. Females predominantly constituted the patient population for MAD and NSRS, aligning with previous research showing higher rates of mood and anxiety disorders among women43?47. The mean age of patients across disorders was in the late thirties to mid-forties, with a trend of decreasing mental disorders with age, consistent with findings by48�and�49. The significant proportion of SSDD patients covered by Medicare highlights the role of insurance type in mental health outcomes, echoing findings of50?52."

743,Predicting mental health disparities using machine learning for African Americans in Southeastern Virginia,"For MAD (Fig.�1), the most robust predictors include alcohol and drug use, with significant regional differences, notably residents from Poquoson City contributing the highest points. For MBD (Fig.�2), psychological factors and age played pivotal roles, with older individuals showing a higher likelihood of MBD, and clinical factors such as complications and liver function underscored the interplay between physical and mental health."
744,Predicting mental health disparities using machine learning for African Americans in Southeastern Virginia,"For MBD, the Gradient Boosting model demonstrated the highest performance with an AUC of 0.955 and a CA of 0.929, along with robust F1 (0.747), precision (0.79), and recall (0.709) scores, indicating its superior predictive capability. LR and ANN also showed strong performance with AUCs of 0.937 and 0.936, respectively, and similar CA and precision metrics. In the MAD category, the GB model again led in performance with an AUC of 0.832 and a balanced F1 score of 0.719, reflecting its reliability in prediction. However, the overall performance metrics for MAD were lower compared to MBD, suggesting potential complexity in modeling MAD outcomes. For SSDD, the GB model achieved the highest AUC at 0.832 and an F1 score of 0.709, highlighting its effectiveness. The LR and ANN models also performed well but exhibited slightly lower metrics across all evaluation criteria. Overall, Gradient Boosting consistently outperformed other models across all disorder categories, particularly excelling in MBD predictions (Table�7)."
745,Predicting mental health disparities using machine learning for African Americans in Southeastern Virginia,"Table�6�explores total charge differences for patients without procedures across MBDD. Gender differences are particularly stark in NSRS, with females incurring 33.4% higher charges than males (p?<?0.05). For Medicare, all groups show significantly higher recipient charges, especially in SSDD (48.2%,�p?<?0.0001). The absence of complications, particularly in NSRS, dramatically lowers charges, highlighting the cost impact of managing complications in mental health care. Differences in admission types are less pronounced here than in table�4�but still significant, with emergency versus elective admissions showing enormous disparities, particularly in MBD (30.0%,�p?<?0.0001). As in table�4, an increase in comorbidities consistently correlates with higher charges, especially in NSRS moving from 4 to 5?+?comorbidities with a 77.3% increase (p?<?0.01)."
746,Predicting mental health disparities using machine learning for African Americans in Southeastern Virginia,"Table�4�presents a comparative analysis of demographic, clinical, and administrative characteristics across MBDD groups. The analysis highlights statistically significant gender differences, with SSDD showing the most considerable disparity (24.1%,�p?<?0.0001) between males and females. Age differences also show significant variances; however, statistically significant differences are noted in MAD (2.9?�?0.2,�p?<?0.0001) and MBD (4.4?�?1,�p?<?0.0001). Medicare coverage significantly differs across groups, with notable differences in SSDD (31.6%,�p?<?0.0001) and MBD (57.3%,�p?<?0.0001), indicating distinct patterns in insurance utilization. The comparison of patients with and without primary procedures reveals significant findings in all groups, particularly MAD (57.5%,�p?<?0.0001), SSDD (60.6%,�p?<?0.0001), and MBD (7.1%,�p?<?0.0001). Complication rates are consistently high across all groups but do not reach statistical significance, suggesting a general trend of high complication rates irrespective of specific disorders. Emergency admission types show significant differences, especially in MBD (42.6%,�p?<?0.0001), emphasizing the urgency in admissions for this group. LOS analysis further emphasizes gender differences, particularly in SSDD, where males exhibit a significantly longer LOS compared to females (2.1?�?2,�p?<?0.0001). This indicates a more complex clinical pathway for males in this group. Post-operative LOS also reflects significant gender differences in NSRS (0.9?�?2,�p?<?0.05) and SSDD (2.1?�?2,�p?<?0.0001), suggesting differential recovery times based on gender (table�3)."

750,Predicting mental health disparities using machine learning for African Americans in Southeastern Virginia,"Data cleaning involves checking for and addressing missing or inconsistent data. Standardized procedures were applied to handle missing data, including imputation methods where appropriate. The study employed a diverse range of statistical methods encompassing both traditional statistical analysis and machine learning to extract meaningful insights from the patient dataset. Descriptive statistics were conducted for several parameters to identify relevant factors for the research question. Demographic factors such as sex and age, clinical factors including complications or comorbidities, and administrative aspects like admission status and length of stay (LOS) were explored. Frequencies were run for all categorical parameters, while means, standard deviations, and medians were calculated for all numeric parameters. Chi-square testing was conducted for the analysis of categorical variables. Given the nonparametric nature of the data, Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon tests were implemented when analyzing numeric data. These tests evaluated differences in demographic, clinical, and administrative factors across mental and behavioral diseases and disorders (MBDD) groups (e.g., mood affective disorders (MAD), schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders (SSDD), mental and behavioral disorders due to psychoactive substance use (MBD), and neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders (NSRS)).

754,Predicting mental health disparities using machine learning for African Americans in Southeastern Virginia,"Despite the growing body of research on mental health disparities, there remains a significant gap in our understanding of the specific patterns, predictors, and outcomes of mental health disorders among African Americans in regionally defined areas. This study aims to address this gap by leveraging a comprehensive dataset from Southeastern Virginia, employing advanced analytical techniques to identify specific trends that can inform targeted interventions and policy decisions. The primary objective of this study was to employ artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methodologies to analyze patterns and predictors of mental health outcomes among underserved populations in the Southeastern Virginia region, with an emphasis on African American communities. Specifically, the study aimed to (a) Examine the impact of various factors (including gender, age, complications, comorbidities, insurance type, and admission source) on mental health outcomes in the Southeastern Virginia area and (b) Develop comprehensive prediction models for mental health outcomes using advanced machine learning techniques."
755,Predicting mental health disparities using machine learning for African Americans in Southeastern Virginia,"African Americans, comprising 13.6% of the U.S. population, experience unique challenges in mental health care. Socioeconomic factors exacerbate these disparities, with 20.1% of African Americans living in poverty�8�and 10.8% lacking health insurance9. While African Americans experience mental illness at rates similar to the general population, they face significant barriers to accessing quality mental health care. Only one in three African Americans in need receives mental health care, with lower rates of service use compared to non-Hispanic whites10. These disparities stem from various factors, including racial and ethnic biases11, stigma12, limited access to care due to financial and geographic constraints, historical trauma13, distrust of the healthcare system14, poorer quality of care, and lack of culturally competent services15�Moreover, African Americans are less likely to receive guideline-consistent care, are underrepresented in research, and are more likely to use emergency rooms or primary care for mental health needs16?19."
756,Predicting mental health disparities using machine learning for African Americans in Southeastern Virginia,"This study examined mental health disparities among African Americans using AI and machine learning for outcome prediction. Analyzing data from African American adults (18?85) in Southeastern Virginia (2016?2020), we found Mood Affective Disorders were most prevalent (41.66%), followed by Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders. Females predominantly experienced mood disorders, with patient ages typically ranging from late thirties to mid-forties. Medicare coverage was notably high among schizophrenia patients, while emergency admissions and comorbidities significantly impacted total healthcare charges. Machine learning models, including gradient boosting, random forest, neural networks, logistic regression, and Naive Bayes, were validated through 100 repeated 5-fold cross-validations. Gradient boosting demonstrated superior predictive performance among all models. Nomograms were developed to visualize risk factors, with gender, age, comorbidities, and insurance type emerging as key predictors. The study revealed higher mental health disorder prevalence compared to national averages, suggesting a potentially greater mental health burden in this population. Despite the limitations of its retrospective design and regional focus, this research provides valuable insights into mental health disparities among African Americans in Southeastern Virginia, particularly regarding demographic and clinical risk factors."
757,Machine learning applications in studying mental health among immigrants and racial and ethnic minorities: an exploratory scoping review,"This review had limitations, including the possibility of missing relevant studies due to specificity in search terms. Future studies should consider using broader search terms to address these limitations. Additionally, the ethical and social implications of using ML in MH, including the potential for perpetuating existing biases and social determinants of health, should be carefully considered. Discussing ethical concerns is important when utilizing textual data related to MH, given the significance of privacy and security of personal information, particularly health data."
758,Machine learning applications in studying mental health among immigrants and racial and ethnic minorities: an exploratory scoping review,"ML exhibits varying degrees of effectiveness across MH conditions, largely influenced by the availability of data and the complexity of symptoms. However, results have been mixed. Nemesure et al. [58] used ML to predict depression and anxiety, achieving moderate success but below clinical standards for diagnostics. These findings show both the potential and current limitations of ML in mental health. While ML can process large datasets and potentially uncover subtle patterns, achieving clinically acceptable accuracy remains challenging. Further research is needed to improve ML models before they can be widely applied in mental health diagnosis and treatment planning. Conversely, in complex disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, while ML can predict episodes, the variability in symptoms poses challenges for model accuracy [59]. Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer?s, also benefit from ML in early detection, though the gradual progression of symptoms limits its immediate utility [60]. In substance use disorders, ML?s ability to track behavioral patterns offers the potential for predicting relapse [61]. Future research should thus focus on enhancing data collection and refining ML models to accommodate the specific needs of each condition while addressing ethical concerns. Also, there is a critical need for addressing algorithmic bias within healthcare to prevent disparities among racial and ethnic minority groups [49]. Chin et al. underline a framework for mitigating bias across an algorithm?s lifecycle, from problem formulation to deployment and monitoring, underscoring the importance of transparency, accountability, and community engagement in ML development [49]."
759,Machine learning applications in studying mental health among immigrants and racial and ethnic minorities: an exploratory scoping review,"Another challenge of using ML for behavioral diagnosis is validating the classification algorithms against questionnaires or clinical diagnoses, which are known to have self-report biases and are not completely accurate. This highlights the lack of established best standards in the diagnosis process for mental disorders and other psychiatric conditions [55]. Future directions include the development of more robust and generalizable algorithms that can improve prediction capabilities. ML can be leveraged to understand the prevalence of MH conditions at a population level by using open-source and freely available data, which can be more accurate and less labor-intensive than traditional surveys. Furthermore, ML can enable the study of MH in children and adolescents in innovative ways [35,�43]. The application of these models can be expanded to different sources and sample sizes, potentially leading to a rapid increase in their use in clinical settings."
760,Machine learning applications in studying mental health among immigrants and racial and ethnic minorities: an exploratory scoping review,"There is still a wide gap in health disparities that persist in accessing quality MH services and outcomes. These gaps primarily concern the limited diversity of populations, the lack of research on complex MH outcomes, and the challenges associated with integrating ML tools in healthcare settings. The current lack of ML models tailored to specific populations presents opportunities and challenges. On the one hand, it can help prevent the perpetuation of health disparities that arise when models built on majority populations are used to misclassify minorities [54]. Performance differences in ML exist for different populations, especially with genomic data. For instance, one study externally validated their algorithm [42] on White Americans rather than African Americans and found that their algorithm?s accuracy decreased. On the other hand, this lack of tailored models highlights the opportunity for researchers and clinicians to bridge the gap between what is known about majority populations and what is yet to be uncovered in other populations. Training ML models on other groups could expedite this process without being too resource-intensive. By proposing future research directions aimed at closing these gaps, we highlight the need for more inclusive data collection, enhanced algorithm training that reflects diverse patient experiences, and comprehensive evaluations of ML tools in real-world clinical settings."
761,Machine learning applications in studying mental health among immigrants and racial and ethnic minorities: an exploratory scoping review,"Recent advances in computational power and software availability have enabled researchers to reach new audiences and demonstrate the clinical value of ML. In particular, some studies have aimed to inform clinicians about the methods and applications of ML in the context of psychotherapy [51]. However, while many of the reviewed papers provide proof-of-concept for the potential use of ML algorithms to address MH concerns, our review finds that the clinical application of these models for classifying and predicting MH disorders is still under development."
762,Machine learning applications in studying mental health among immigrants and racial and ethnic minorities: an exploratory scoping review,"While ML algorithms can effectively handle large volumes of EHR data for risk prediction, it?s important to note that they still require significant manual input and optimization [47,�49]. Unlike traditional statistical techniques that often involve manual selection and imputation of specific variables, ML models can potentially consider a broader range of data points [44,�48]. However, these models typically require extensive tuning, which involves considerable manual labor and decision-making on the part of developers. Additionally, ML can sometimes capture more intricate, non-linear relationships without the need for explicit specification of interaction terms."
763,Machine learning applications in studying mental health among immigrants and racial and ethnic minorities: an exploratory scoping review,"This exploratory scoping review explores the application of ML in MH research, focusing on vulnerable populations including immigrants, refugees, and ethnic minorities. Our findings reveal that ML is increasingly used to enhance MH diagnostics, screening, and interventions."
764,Machine learning applications in studying mental health among immigrants and racial and ethnic minorities: an exploratory scoping review,"Six studies used internal cross-validation methods [31,�35,�36,�38,�39,�43]. Only one study used an external data set to validate their ML algorithm [42]. That external validation of the algorithm reduced the accuracy of their algorithm from 78% to 70?75% [42]. Almost half of the included publications did not use or discuss their cross-validation method [32?34,�37,�41]."
765,Machine learning applications in studying mental health among immigrants and racial and ethnic minorities: an exploratory scoping review,"Two studies did not report the best algorithm performance [37,�41]. For the other studies, accuracy and AUC were commonly reported. For example, Acion et al. classified substance use disorder treatment success in Hispanic patients and found that the AUC of studied models ranged from 0.793 to 0.820, with the ensemble method achieving an AUC of 0.820, which was not significantly better than the traditional logistic regression model?s AUC of 0.805 [36]. Huber et al. identified a tree algorithm that differentiated native Europeans and non-European migrants with schizophrenia with an accuracy of 74.5% and a predictive power of AUC?=?0.75 [38]. In Liu et al., the trained ML model had an accuracy of 78% in predicting ADHD in African American patients [42]. In a similar study to classify ADHD, depression, anxiety, autism, intellectual disabilities, speech/language disorder, developmental delays, and oppositional defiant disorder in African Americans, the model had an accuracy of 65% in distinguishing patients with at least one MH diagnosis from controls [43]. A second prediction model aimed at predicting the diagnosis of two or more MH disorders had a low accuracy level, with an exact match rate of 7.2?9.3% [43]. Khatua and Nejdl [40] analyzed tweets acquired from Twitter feeds from self-identified refugees and categorized them into themes of the immigrant struggle with an accuracy of 61.61% and 75.89%."
766,Machine learning applications in studying mental health among immigrants and racial and ethnic minorities: an exploratory scoping review,"The publications used a range of ML models, from one [31?35,�42,�43] to 16 [36]. In studies where multiple ML models were used, the aim was often to compare the models to determine the best predictive power. For example, Acion et al. compared 16 models and evaluated them using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to classify substance use disorder treatment success in Hispanic patients [36]. Huber et al. compared five different ML algorithms, including decision trees, support vector machines, na�ve Bayes, logistic regression, and K-nearest neighbor, to determine the model with the best predictive power for classifying schizophrenia spectrum disorders in migrants [38]. Two of the studies used linear regression [33,�34]. All of the studies developed custom models to meet their study aims. The most common programs used in these studies were R [31,�36], SPSS [32,�34], and Python [40,�42,�43]."

Another study analyzed drawings from 2480 Syrian refugee children to find the predictors of exposure to violence and mental well-being [35]. Other sample sets analyzed 0.15�million unique tweets from Twitter [40] and 441,000 unique conversations from internet message boards and social media sites [41]. Genomic sequencing data was collected from 4,179 Black individuals [43] and 524 Black individuals [42]."

Figure�1�shows the flow of our search strategy and results. All records from PsycINFO and PubMed were reviewed, an additional 280 records were reviewed from Google Scholar, and the most relevant 100 were reviewed from EMBASE. Based on titles and abstracts, 79 were selected and further reviewed. Most of these records were excluded because they did not focus on the population of interest. Instead, they focused on majority populations and racially homogenous populations and/or did not include discussions about immigrant/migrant status. We also reviewed five abstracts from citation searching. Ultimately, 13 publications were included in this review."
770,Machine learning applications in studying mental health among immigrants and racial and ethnic minorities: an exploratory scoping review,"Data were extracted from each article, including study context, the focus on mental healthcare, sample, data type, type of ML algorithm used, and algorithm performance. A narrative synthesis approach was applied."
771,Machine learning applications in studying mental health among immigrants and racial and ethnic minorities: an exploratory scoping review,"Two reviewers (KP and AA) independently conducted searches in Google Scholar, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and PubMed from October 2022 to March 2024. All queries had three components: an ML-related term (e.g., ?machine learning,? ?artificial intelligence?), an MH-related term (e.g., ?mental health,? depression, ?post-traumatic stress disorder?), and a population of a focus search term (e.g., immigrant, refugee, minority*). These terms were combined with the Boolean operators to create final search strings. Queries were conducted on titles, keywords, and abstracts. Backward reference searching was also conducted, reviewing references from the articles that matched our search criteria for more articles that could fit our inclusion criteria. See the Appendix for full query syntax."
772,Machine learning applications in studying mental health among immigrants and racial and ethnic minorities: an exploratory scoping review,"Our search terms reflect this comprehensive approach, including both specific psychiatric diagnoses and related mental health conditions. This allows us to capture the full potential of ML applications in mental health, from common disorders to more complex and less frequent conditions, providing a thorough exploration of the field?s current state and future directions."
773,Machine learning applications in studying mental health among immigrants and racial and ethnic minorities: an exploratory scoping review,"Machine learning encompasses a variety of algorithms and statistical models that enable programs to improve their performance on a task through experience. In the context of MH research, ML techniques can be broadly categorized into supervised learning, where models are trained on labeled data to predict outcomes, and unsupervised learning, which identifies patterns in unlabeled data [21?24]. The application of ML in health sciences, including mental health, has been growing. ML models have been developed to predict risk scores for various mental health conditions, potentially aiding in diagnosis and screening [25?27]. While several reviews have discussed ML applications in mental health research [28,�29], there?s been limited focus on how these models address factors such as race, ethnicity, or immigration status. For example, Maslej et al. [30] conducted a rapid review using a Critical Race Theory perspective to examine how race and racialization are defined in ML applications for Major Depressive Disorder, but their study did not extend to other common mental disorders or broader mental health issues."
774,Machine learning applications in studying mental health among immigrants and racial and ethnic minorities: an exploratory scoping review,"Mental health (MH) disparities are significantly influenced by stigma, discrimination, and socioeconomic challenges [2,�5]. These disparities are exacerbated for minority populations who often face limited access to MH services due to geographic, economic, and literacy barriers, leading to lower satisfaction with healthcare and higher dropout rates from MH services compared to Whites [6?10]. Black and Latinx individuals, for example, are at higher risk of persistence and disability from CMDs [11?13]. While Asian Americans are considered to have better MH status compared to Whites and other racial and ethnic minorities, this is poorly studied [14]. Immigrants often experience a temporary improvement in MH upon arrival, known as the ?immigration paradox?, but their MH deteriorates over time due to assimilation stresses, racism, discriminatory and exclusionary policies, status loss, and sometimes violence [5,�15?18]. Refugees face significantly higher rates of severe psychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder, due to adverse pre-migration conditions [16,�19]."

776,Machine learning applications in studying mental health among immigrants and racial and ethnic minorities: an exploratory scoping review,"Ultimately, 13 peer-reviewed publications were included. All the articles were published within the last 6 years, and over half of them studied populations within the US. Most reviewed studies used supervised learning to explain or predict MH outcomes. Some publications used up to 16 models to determine the best predictive power. Almost half of the included publications did not discuss their cross-validation method."
777,Machine learning applications in studying mental health among immigrants and racial and ethnic minorities: an exploratory scoping review,"The use of machine learning (ML) in mental health (MH) research is increasing, especially as new, more complex data types become available to analyze. By examining the published literature, this review aims to explore the current applications of ML in MH research, with a particular focus on its use in studying diverse and vulnerable populations, including immigrants, refugees, migrants, and racial and ethnic minorities."

781,Mental Health Applications of Generative AI and Large Language Modeling in the United States,"There are multiple recommendations that can aid in integrating AI with mental health services. With initial integration of AI in the mental health field, there can be further enrichment of training data, making the application more accurate and less biased. This can help alleviate some of the burden that is experienced by general health practitioners. One application that researchers have used is synthesizing attack trees using LLMs to predict cyberattack scenarios, potentially jeopardizing medical privacy in mental health, thereby fostering mistrust. Most recently, the AI Digital Bill of Rights has been established to ensure safe and effective systems, data privacy, and algorithmic discrimination protections [52,53,54,55]. In the following section, we outline some of the important recommendations in applying AI in mental health."
782,Mental Health Applications of Generative AI and Large Language Modeling in the United States,"We did not study the impact of certain systematic approaches to understanding AI. Further innovative approaches should be explored in future studies. One such approach is to conduct AI risk management. Artificial Intelligence Trust [43], Risk and Security Management (AI TRiSM) is a systematic approach to manage risks of AI. Applying the discipline of mental health, future studies should explore the effectiveness of frameworks to mitigate such risks of releasing sensitive information. Furthermore, bias is another serious threat against creating optimal AI models. AI applications will not mitigate mental health disparities if they are built from historical data that reflect underlying social biases and inequities [44]. In mental health applications, AI-related hallucinations, due to biases in the data, inadequate training, or flawed algorithms, can also be a potential negative byproduct of overreliance on this technology."
783,Mental Health Applications of Generative AI and Large Language Modeling in the United States,"There are many applications of AI in mental health that are very positive as well. However, other researchers have found a potential improvement by applying conversational agent AI, i.e., chatbots, to capture dynamic human behavior adequately to provide responses tailored to users? personalities [41]. Researchers in the field of human?machine interaction stressed the importance of avoiding ?one-size-fits-all? interactions. V�lkel et al. found approaches to adapt a voice assistant?s personality to the user, improving the interactive experience [42]. This adaptive automated user experience can prove to be a useful application of AI."
784,Mental Health Applications of Generative AI and Large Language Modeling in the United States,"One caveat of our findings is that due to AI being in the news so frequently, some of the peaks in search volume were attributed to news announcements. For instance, as of the writing of this article, US and China agreed to create an infrastructure to map out a framework for developing AI responsibly, creating an increased level of interest in the topic area [40]. Using the Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale (LEAS), Elyoseph et al. found that ChatGPT-3.5 demonstrated an exceptional ability to differentiate and elucidate emotions from textual cues, outperforming human sample norms [24]. This can lead to the AI-driven administration of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) according to the emotions detected in the patient."
785,Mental Health Applications of Generative AI and Large Language Modeling in the United States,"Another novel finding in our study was that the interest in AI in mental health has been increasing throughout 2023 and is expected to increase by 114% throughout the year 2024. This shows that awareness will increase over time for public health and mental health practitioners alike. In comparison, we found, through geospatial analysis, that there is a shortage in mental health providers across the country, necessitating the importance of AI-guided mental health services. More and more people are relying on ChatGPT and generative AI to receive medical advice in lieu of a physician?s advice [38]. Additionally, AI can unfold the possibilities of applications in mental health treatment."
786,Mental Health Applications of Generative AI and Large Language Modeling in the United States,"In recent times, society has been gripped with curiosity about the potential that this new technology of generative AI has for use in the discipline of mental health. In fact, the potential in mental health is seemingly limitless [27]. According to our study, a novel finding was that the search volume and awareness of artificial intelligence increased by 257% from January to April of 2023. As more mental health datapoints will become available, generative AI will be leveraged and harnessed to improve many mental health discoveries and diagnostic methods [28,29,30]. The discipline of mental health is no exception in helping unleash the potential of AI. The increase in Google searches related to AI and mental health between January 2023 and December 2023 may reflect increasing public recognition of the clinical aspects addressing them. More specific terms relating to depression and anxiety as they relate to AI are not as frequently searched but alowly increasing in popularity. Healthcare practitioners should use plain English terms for online discovery of AI-driven mental health resources and be aware of health literacy."
787,Mental Health Applications of Generative AI and Large Language Modeling in the United States,"According to�Table 2�and�Figure 2, the projected RSV through December 2024 is expected to increase from 25.5 to 54.6, indicating a 114% increase throughout the year. This aligns with the findings from�Figure 1d, where an increase is already indicated in the year 2023."
788,Mental Health Applications of Generative AI and Large Language Modeling in the United States,"As seen in�Figure 1, the RSV for the year 2023 varied according to the search volume in mental health and AI. According to�Figure 1b, the term ?AI? was already popular, and the trend line demonstrates that by the end of 2023, the search for this search term had drastically risen throughout the year. The next terms searched along with AI demonstrated further variations. The term ?AI? was tested with ?mental health? (Figure 1d), ?anxiety? (Figure 1c), and ?depression? (Figure 1a) individually to determine search term volume. In�Figure 1d, ?AI and mental health? demonstrates an increasing trend; however, the starting RSV was slightly lower than ?AI? alone.�Figure 1c,d demonstrate a steady trend with no change in RSV between the beginning of the year and the end of the year."
789,Mental Health Applications of Generative AI and Large Language Modeling in the United States,"We used the Box?Jenkins time series modeling estimation method to determine what the search volume of ?AI and mental health? will be by the end of 2024. Autoregression (ARIMA) and other statistical analyses were run using SAS v.9.4. Diagnostics for the four models were completed checking for autocorrelation. The adequacy of the model was tested using chi-square test statistics for white-noise residuals. Our autoregressive integrated moving average model is robust to time series biases, such as recurring periodicities. Additionally, a trend line for the time series plot with additional Lowess estimators plot, a nonparametric regression, was generated. Here linear methods do not perform well. Lowess fits a regression line through the moving central tendency of ?AI? along the time gradient. Additionally, using ArcGIS, we geospatially analyzed the County Health Rankings 2023 to assess the distribution of mental health workers per 100,000."
790,Mental Health Applications of Generative AI and Large Language Modeling in the United States,"In this study, we used Google Trends, and, through search patterns on the Internet, we analyzed the web queries that were made in the search engines, such as the Google website search engine. All the searches were conducted within the United States. To conduct analyses, we downloaded the data for all searches in the United States."
791,Mental Health Applications of Generative AI and Large Language Modeling in the United States,"With the lack of efficacy and adherence to mental health medications, AI technology has become an integral tool to better understand the consequences of mental health and create more targeted therapies [20,21]. While the application of artificial intelligence is not new, the rapid spread of generative AI and large language modeling is recent and has immense potential in diagnosing and treating mental health conditions [22]. In fact, the potential of mental health is seemingly limitless and broad in scope. What is not known is how much interest there is for generative artificial intelligence, particularly around mental health."
792,Mental Health Applications of Generative AI and Large Language Modeling in the United States,"According to the Substance Use and Mental Health Service Administration (SAMHSA), mental illness and substance use disorder treatment spending from all public and private sources was USD 280.5 billion in 2020, an increase from USD 171.7 billion in 2009 [19]. Major depressive disorder is now considered the leading cause of disability worldwide. However, in the discipline of mental health, there is a high rate of medication nonadherence. Medication nonadherence is higher among people with mental health disorders than chronic physical conditions. Additionally, chronic diseases may need to be addressed after successfully treating mental health conditions."
793,Mental Health Applications of Generative AI and Large Language Modeling in the United States,"Many treatments of depression and anxiety have proven to be ineffective against mental health disorders, due to which lack of medical adherence is a concern. Treatment for mental health disorders is only about 30% effective [16]. The lack of efficacy is due to the lack of understanding, requiring the use of more sophisticated algorithms. There are many other reasons for the lack of effectiveness of treatment, including stigma and lack of access. Artificial intelligence can integrate genetic heterogeneity and other considerations to utilize the concept of personalized medicine, to create tailored treatment towards the individual."
794,Mental Health Applications of Generative AI and Large Language Modeling in the United States,"In many countries and certain areas within the United States, there is fewer than one psychiatrist per every 100,000 population. Tutun et al. found [10] that AI can be used to create decision support systems to accurately predict mental health disorders as indicated in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and International Classification of Diseases. Furthermore, there is still room for artificial intelligence applications in mental health. For instance, typically, primary care physicians are not trained in mental health, necessitating further collaboration. AI offers a lot of promise in applying, appreciating, and embracing the application of mental health. More specifically, AI has revolutionized how magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows for improved diagnosis through providing higher-resolution images and potential biological changes that are connected to depression [11]. Other instances of AI application include diagnosing sepsis in premature babies from metrics such as vital signs and monitoring devices [12,13]. Even though in medicine there are many examples of AI applications, there is not a thorough understanding of how artificial intelligence has impacted the field of mental health."
795,Mental Health Applications of Generative AI and Large Language Modeling in the United States,"Many people learn about medical conditions by relying on using Google and other search engines. There are well-researched and efficacious applications in the fields of cardiology, radiology, and surgery, among other areas of medicine. Due to the technical nature of LLM, there is trepidation in applying the novel technology to medicine. Over recent years, as social media has become a source of medical information, researchers found that analyzing user-generated data can improve the effectiveness of AI and increase access to medical information by the public [8]. Even Twitter data have been used for LLM-driven sentiment analysis and can contain vital information to diagnose depression and even suicidal ideation. Many social media users often express their perspectives and thoughts of depression and suicide on these platforms."
796,Mental Health Applications of Generative AI and Large Language Modeling in the United States,"There are novel generative AI tools, such as Google Bard (LaMDA), ChatSonic API, Microsoft?s GPT-3, and Facebook?s Robustly Optimized BERT Pre-training Approach (RoBERTa), that have the potential to alleviate some of the mental health provider shortages. One of the original generative AI tools, ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer), represents a revolution in the world of artificial intelligence. OpenAI, debuted in 2020, advanced this conversational AI technology powered by a linguistic model known as GPT, short for Generative Pre-Training Transformer [3]. The ChatGPT-3 model was the latest in a line of large pretrained models designed for understanding and producing natural language [1,2]. In recent times, society has been gripped with awe about the potential that this new technology brings to the area of mental health."
797,Mental Health Applications of Generative AI and Large Language Modeling in the United States,"(1) Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has flourished in recent years. More specifically, generative AI has had broad applications in many disciplines. While mental illness is on the rise, AI has proven valuable in aiding the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders. However, there is little to no research about precisely how much interest there is in AI technology. (2) Methods: We performed a Google Trends search for ?AI and mental health? and compared relative search volume (RSV) indices of ?AI?, ?AI and Depression?, and ?AI and anxiety?. This time series study employed Box?Jenkins time series modeling to forecast long-term interest through the end of 2024. (3) Results: Within the United States, AI interest steadily increased throughout 2023, with some anomalies due to media reporting. Through predictive models, we found that this trend is predicted to increase 114% through the end of the year 2024, with public interest in AI applications being on the rise. (4) Conclusions: According to our study, we found that the awareness of AI has drastically increased throughout 2023, especially in mental health. This demonstrates increasing public awareness of mental health and AI, making advocacy and education about AI technology of paramount importance."
798,"Insights Derived From Text-Based Digital Media, in Relation to Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, Using Data Analysis and Machine Learning: Systematic Review","Future research could focus on investigating further benefits of textual digital media analysis in mental health and suicide prevention when dealing with depression and, importantly, what makes people happy. Machine learning can be used to predict what are the sources of ?happiness? or even how different activities make different socioeconomic groups ?happy,? and these insights can then be used to assist in the development of a wide range of digital interventions, such as chatbots."
799,"Insights Derived From Text-Based Digital Media, in Relation to Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, Using Data Analysis and Machine Learning: Systematic Review","The efficacy of digital tools was also analyzed, with machine learning approaches being used to understand users? opinions regarding mental health apps. Using positive and negative sentiments, it was shown that those with mental illness are digitally connected and are incorporating these tools to manage their health. Predictive analytics was also identified to be able to detect cognitive distortions, which are associated with depression and anxiety, from personal blogs with an accuracy of 73%, while other machine learning models were able to predict the risk of suicidal ideation from social media. The use of modern technology has also been investigated, with the application of VR-based interventions showing promising contributions to the field of military and veteran mental health by developing new approaches to delivering preventive or curative care."
800,"Insights Derived From Text-Based Digital Media, in Relation to Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, Using Data Analysis and Machine Learning: Systematic Review","This study exhibits limitations in the selection of articles because it used only 4 journal databases (ie, Web of Science, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO) as well as Google Scholar. Moreover, only articles published in English and related to mental health or suicide, machine learning and data analysis, and digital interventions were included. The search for articles started in March 2023, and the collected articles were published between 2013 and 2023. As some of the researched articles identified some sort of machine learning classification or prediction, we should have considered explainable artificial intelligence to facilitate the understanding of any predictions made by the machine learning models to better understand the models? behavior. Another limitation involves how the inclusion and exclusion of papers were resolved. Even though CS, EE, MDM, and RB assessed the papers and decided what was to be included or excluded based on the applicability criteria, it was CS who made the final decision about what went into this review."
801,"Insights Derived From Text-Based Digital Media, in Relation to Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, Using Data Analysis and Machine Learning: Systematic Review","Insights from data analysis and machine learning can be used to assist in the development of digital interventions, and the effectiveness of these interventions can be shown to provide support to people living with depression and improve mental well-being. Through textual data analysis, it was determined, for example, that posts signaling cognitive change exhibit longer word lengths and that support seekers who have not undergone cognitive change tend to express themselves more in web-based replies. Similarly, it was found that there was a heightened prevalence of digital interest among individuals with anxiety or depression. NLP and machine learning can also be used to predict therapeutic alliance between the patient and therapist."
802,"Insights Derived From Text-Based Digital Media, in Relation to Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, Using Data Analysis and Machine Learning: Systematic Review","Machine learning and data analysis techniques can also be used to detect mental ill health and suicidal risk, where neural network models can be used to predict suicide ideation before suicidal thoughts are articulated and to generate models capable of predicting individuals who would be at risk of suicidal thoughts. These tools can also be used to comprehend help seeking for mental health difficulties. Survey data were analyzed to understand help seeking in relation to mental health, identifying that the role of the family is important in encouraging help seeking for war veterans and revealing substantial barriers to help seeking, particularly in relation to the military culture, such as the belief that mental health concerns can be self-managed (if recognized) and a fear of being judged by others."
803,"Insights Derived From Text-Based Digital Media, in Relation to Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, Using Data Analysis and Machine Learning: Systematic Review","There are many ways in which data analysis can be used to support mental well-being; for example, textual data analysis can be used to signal cognitive change, where it has been found that the average word length within text is longer for posts that indicate a cognitive or emotional change [29]. Other analysis results indicate a high prevalence of digital interest among people with anxiety or depression [23], and when NLP and machine learning were used to predict therapeutic alliance, the mean rating showed a typical negative skew found in the assessment of the alliance [15]. VR-based interventions, wearable technology, and text mining are expected to be promising tools in psychiatric assessments in the future [24]. Regarding the use of log data to improve the uptake of a web-based intervention, user pattern recognition from earlier lessons can be applied to tailor the intervention and support the uptake of content essential for therapy [25]. For web-based and non?web-based mental health apps, the majority of the reviews from a study of mental health apps available on Google Play and the App Store were positive, showing that most users found mental health apps useful and helpful [30]."
804,"Insights Derived From Text-Based Digital Media, in Relation to Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, Using Data Analysis and Machine Learning: Systematic Review","Vermetten et al [24] investigated the potential use of virtual reality (VR)?based interventions, wearable technology, and text mining to enhance the mental health of military personnel and veterans. Using text mining and the statistical technique of item response theory, they demonstrated that there was a high agreement of 82% with the diagnoses provided by psychiatrists and suggested that the combination of text mining and VR-based interventions holds promise as a valuable tool for psychological and psychiatric assessments in the future."
805,"Insights Derived From Text-Based Digital Media, in Relation to Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, Using Data Analysis and Machine Learning: Systematic Review","Research by Chikersal et al [22] provided a deeper understanding of how supporter behaviors impact the use of web-based therapy programs. The methodology involved the application of unsupervised machine learning, along with statistical and data mining methods, to analyze complex, large-scale supporter-client interactions. They found that concrete, positive, and supportive feedback from supporters, particularly those referencing social behaviors, were strongly associated with better outcomes. This suggests the importance of identifying effective context-specific support strategies using data for personalized mental health support. This knowledge can contribute to improving the design and implementation of personalized human support in internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy and enhance our understanding of big data in digital health interventions."
806,"Insights Derived From Text-Based Digital Media, in Relation to Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, Using Data Analysis and Machine Learning: Systematic Review","Research by Goldberg et al [15] used NLP and machine learning techniques to predict one of the most studied process variables in psychotherapy: therapeutic alliance. The methodology involved using Sent2vec to map sentences to vectors of real numbers, and linear regression was then used as the prediction model. The findings of the study revealed that across the 1235 alliance ratings, the mean rating was 5.47 (SD 0.83), indicating a negative slant often found in the assessment of therapeutic alliance. The implications drawn from these findings suggest that machine learning holds promise for predicting observable linguistic behaviors, these models could be trained using human coding as the gold standard, and thorough testing should be conducted using large data sets."
807,"Insights Derived From Text-Based Digital Media, in Relation to Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, Using Data Analysis and Machine Learning: Systematic Review","An analysis of survey data has been shown to identify help seeking for mental health difficulties. Research by Waddell et al [18] sought to examine survey data to gain insights into the dynamics of help-seeking relationships within veteran families. The findings of the study brought to light that family members of veterans play a significant role in both the initial and ongoing processes of seeking help. However, the study also revealed substantial barriers to help seeking, primarily linked to the military culture. These barriers included the belief that mental health concerns could be self-managed (if recognized), highlighting concerns about potential impacts on careers and the fear of judgment by others. Educating families about identifying early signs of mental health problems is crucial to inform families about the potential mental health risks associated with military careers. This knowledge can then contribute to fostering a supportive environment and breaking down barriers to help seeking within veteran families."
808,"Insights Derived From Text-Based Digital Media, in Relation to Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, Using Data Analysis and Machine Learning: Systematic Review","These findings show that it is possible to detect cognitive distortions automatically from personal blogs with an accuracy of 73% [12], and this could lead to an earlier detection of anxiety and possible intervention at an earlier stage. Neural network models, which are powerful machine learning tools, have been shown to successfully detect mental disorders and suicidal risk, where certain models were shown to predict suicide ideation even before suicidal thoughts were articulated [28]."
809,"Insights Derived From Text-Based Digital Media, in Relation to Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, Using Data Analysis and Machine Learning: Systematic Review","Machine learning can be used in the detection of cognitive distortions, which may fuel anxiety, and in the detection of those at risk of suicide. Roy et al [28] developed a model capable of predicting individuals at risk and assessing the likelihood of experiencing suicidal thoughts within a specific time frame. This involved using a random forest model that used output from neural networks to predict binary suicidal ideation status when there is a match with at least one of the word patterns in the ordered word screening, for example, ?feeling suicidal.? This study found that the neural network models successfully predicted suicidal ideation even before individuals articulated explicit thoughts of suicide. These findings suggest that there may be potential for predicting suicidal ideation before individuals explicitly express such thoughts, offering opportunities for early intervention and support."

They used the latent Dirichlet allocation method for topic modeling and the Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner for sentiment analysis. Their findings indicated that sentiment scores were initially high and stable but exhibited a significant decrease over time, indicating reduced sentiment over the long term."

The methodology involved statistical analyses using SPSS (IBM Corp) to evaluate survey data. The findings revealed a noteworthy impact of the pandemic, indicating that respondents experienced more severe mental symptoms when their residential communities were more exposed to SARS-CoV-2. The implications drawn from these findings suggest that mental health conditions among survey respondents varied based on the level of the COVID-19 pandemic severity. Notably, residents in communities with a high severity of the pandemic exhibited more pronounced symptoms of depression and anxiety."

813,"Insights Derived From Text-Based Digital Media, in Relation to Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, Using Data Analysis and Machine Learning: Systematic Review","Sentiment was measured for various studies; it was measured as positive for a web-based community platform for mental health [26], and text had a positive score, which correlated with the number of likes [20] of the posts. Another survey [23] found that respondents with anxiety or depression were generally more likely to report that their smart device had helped them in their discussions with their health care providers, compared to respondents that did not have anxiety or depression (42.7% vs 35.3%;�P=.03). Furthermore, a negative tone was observed in 66% of conversations among Hispanic populations compared to 39% of conversations among non-Hispanic populations [13], and the total causal effect of disability acquisition on mental health was estimated to be a 4.8-point decline in mental health [16]. Moreover, there was a negative trajectory in sentiment scores from a longitudinal analysis of Twitter data during the COVID-19 pandemic [27]. Another study [14] reported a higher percentage of adults with epilepsy showing a defeatist attitude compared to teenagers with epilepsy (42% vs 4%). In a family well-being study, 53% of respondents thought seeking help would negatively affect their career, and 63% were afraid to ask for help [18]. The results of a questionnaire to establish the mental health of Chinese web-based networkers found that with an increase in socioeconomic status, depression decreased by a margin of ?0.52 (P<.001) [17]."
814,"Insights Derived From Text-Based Digital Media, in Relation to Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, Using Data Analysis and Machine Learning: Systematic Review","This review aimed to determine how machine learning and data analysis can be used to assess text-based digital media data in relation to mental health and suicide prevention. Regarding the type of analysis and outcome measures used within the publications reviewed in this study, machine learning and text-based data analysis were used in 4 (21%) of the 19 studies [12-15]. A total of 3 (16%) studies performed some sort of analysis on survey or questionnaire data [16-19], and 3 (16%) papers analyzed the value of text-based digital media [20-22]. The analysis of digital interventions was the main type of analysis used by Onyeaka et al [23], Vermetten et al [24], and Van Gemert-Pijnen et al [25]. The remaining types of investigations included the analysis of forum or discussion data [26] and longitudinal analysis [27]. Where machine learning was used for prediction within the studies, the outcome metrics were also listed in the table. These include the study by Roy et al [28], who investigated how machine learning approaches could be used to predict suicidal ideation from social media data. They trained a random forest model using neural networks to predict suicide ideation status with an area under the curve of 0.88. Gu et al [29] used convolutional neural network for text for classifier training and classification, which produced the following scores: precision=0.84, recall=0.84, and�F1-score=0.84. Oyebode et al [30] used 5 different machine learning methods to evaluate mental health apps based on user reviews. The 5 models produced similar scores, with the stochastic gradient descent showing the best performance of the 5 classifiers (Table 1)."
815,"Insights Derived From Text-Based Digital Media, in Relation to Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, Using Data Analysis and Machine Learning: Systematic Review","A total of 27 records were identified according to the search methods explained in the�Search Strategy�section.

816,"Insights Derived From Text-Based Digital Media, in Relation to Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, Using Data Analysis and Machine Learning: Systematic Review","With the rise in the use of smartphones, digital interventions have been able to offer a solution to address the increasing demand for mental health services [8] and to relieve certain barriers in mental health provision, such as the stigma around accessing psychological health services and geographic isolation [9]. This paper presents a systematic review of the research on the application of machine learning and data analysis to text-based digital media data in relation to mental health and suicide prevention to help answer the following research question: How can machine learning and data analysis be applied to text-based digital media data to understand mental health and aid suicide prevention?"
817,"Insights Derived From Text-Based Digital Media, in Relation to Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, Using Data Analysis and Machine Learning: Systematic Review","Social media platforms have become significant sources of data for studying mental health and suicide prevention, where researchers have explored the potential of using platforms such as X (X Corp), formerly known as�Twitter (Twitter, Inc) and Facebook (Meta Platforms, Inc) to gain insights into individuals? mental well-being, detect mental health concerns, and identify suicide risk factors. For example, Coppersmith et al [1] developed a machine learning model to detect signals related to depression in user posts on Twitter, achieving promising results. In addition, De Choudhury et al [2] analyzed Facebook posts to identify individuals at risk of depression, demonstrating the feasibility of using social media data for mental health monitoring. Research methods involve various techniques, including sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and natural language processing (NLP), to analyze large volumes of data and identify patterns and trends. For instance, Park et al [3] applied sentiment analysis to examine suicide-related tweets and identified specific linguistic features associated with suicidal ideation. Sik et al [4] used topic modeling to identify mental health?related topics in web-based forums, facilitating targeted interventions and support. In addition, Burnap et al [5] used NLP techniques to analyze web-based content and identify individuals expressing suicidal ideation, which could enable timely interventions."
818,"Insights Derived From Text-Based Digital Media, in Relation to Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, Using Data Analysis and Machine Learning: Systematic Review","Our findings show that data analysis and machine learning can be used to gain valuable insights, such as the following: web-based conversations relating to depression vary among different ethnic groups, teenagers engage in a web-based conversation about suicide more often than adults, and people seeking support in web-based mental health communities feel better after receiving online support. Digital tools and mental health apps are being used successfully to manage mental health, particularly through the COVID-19 epidemic, during which analysis has revealed that there was increased anxiety and depression, and web-based communities played a part in reducing isolation during the pandemic. Predictive analytics were also shown to have potential, and virtual reality shows promising results in the delivery of preventive or curative care. Future research efforts could center on optimizing algorithms to enhance the potential of text-based digital media analysis in mental health and suicide prevention. In addressing depression, a crucial step involves identifying the factors that contribute to happiness and using machine learning to forecast these sources of�happiness. This could extend to understanding how various activities result in improved happiness across different socioeconomic groups. Using insights gathered from such data analysis and machine learning, there is an opportunity to craft digital interventions, such as chatbots, designed to provide support and address mental health challenges and suicide prevention."

821,Taking a trauma and adversity perspective to climate change mental health,"The growing evidence that communities impacted by disasters are increasingly impacted by multiple disasters blurs the question of when the most appropriate time is to intervene with an intervention like the SOLAR programme. For a single disaster event, the idea of 3?12 months post disaster is a useful time to consider utilising interventions targeted to psychosocial distress. However, for communities impacted by multiple disasters over time, this is less clear. It may be that an intervention like the SOLAR programme which is conducted in the aftermath of a particular disaster (as a recovery response) becomes a part of a preparedness response for a future disaster. It is essential that research and policy agendas consider systems being impacted by multiple disasters, and recognise that communities may be simultaneously engaging in preparedness, response and recovery phases relating to different disaster events."
822,Taking a trauma and adversity perspective to climate change mental health,"The psychosocial needs of communities post-disaster are highly complex, and the specific needs of individuals can vary greatly. Although effective psychological interventions for disaster-related mental health problems exist, the scarcity of mental health workers limits the practicality of trained mental health professionals delivering sustained care to individuals and communities affected by disaster. Task-shifting approaches, which shift service delivery from highly qualified health workers to individuals with lower qualifications (Seidman & Atun,�2017), may be one way of increasing community capability to respond to the mental health needs post-disaster."
823,Taking a trauma and adversity perspective to climate change mental health,"It is worth noting that factors influencing mental health outcomes post-disaster are not restricted to individual-level personal characteristics, but also include higher-level factors concerning the disaster itself or the community?s subsequent response. Factors such as the severity of disaster and level of exposure to the event can confer further vulnerability for mental health problems (Khan et al.,�2023). Indeed, after the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake (Ohnuma et al.,�2023), exposure to television media coverage of the victims was associated with greater psychopathology among children and greater psychological distress among their parents."
824,Taking a trauma and adversity perspective to climate change mental health,"Studying the protective factors which promote mental health resilience in the face of adversity and trauma ? both at the individual and community levels ? is essential to informing preparedness and response to climate change events. Frameworks of post-disaster resilience highlight that community systems and social support are central ecological resources that buffer against the negative mental health effects of climate change and related disasters (Ungar & Theron,�2020). In this Special Issue, Bakic and Ajdukovic (2021) found that interpersonal and community resources, including social support from loved ones and the community; as well as individual resources, such as psychological resilience; were associated with greater mental health and life satisfaction in members of flood-affected communities in Croatia. Similarly, Liu et al. (2021) found greater social support increases self-compassion and posttraumatic growth in the aftermath of trauma; as well as increasing prosocial and reducing antisocial behaviours. Individual-level psychosocial resources are also critical protective factors against negative mental health outcomes, with Tekin et al. (2023) finding that in survivors of Hurricane Katrina, factors such as hope for the future, efficient coping strategies, and acceptance of the situation were associated with recovery trajectories of posttraumatic stress, reflected in improvements in individuals? symptoms over time. While the cumulative impacts of climate change are severe, this evidence points to a number of individual- and community-level protective factors which may buffer the negative mental health effects of climate change-related disaster events and lasting environmental changes."
825,Taking a trauma and adversity perspective to climate change mental health,"A range of mental health outcomes has been associated with the impacts of climate change-related disaster events. Although disaster events are frequently traumatic in nature and are most typically associated with the emergence of posttraumatic stress symptoms (Agyapong et al.,�2022; Chen et al.,�2023; Massazza et al.,�2022; van der Does et al.,�2023), the mental health sequelae of disasters are complex and may also include symptoms of anxiety (Agyapong et al.,�2022; Richez et al.,�2022), depression (Agyapong et al.,�2022; Chen et al.,�2023), and general psychological distress (Pardon et al.,�2024; Zhang et al.,�2022). Further, a scoping review article in this Special Issue indicated that amongst individuals, lasting environmental changes associated with climate change (particularly heat and heatwaves) result in increased mortality risk, suicide and suicidal behaviours, and psychiatric morbidity amongst individuals with mental health conditions (Massazza et al.,�2022). It is therefore clear that the mental health impacts of climate change extend beyond the acute effects of natural disasters, and that long-term alterations to the environment caused by climate change will continue to worsen mental health outcomes over time."
826,Taking a trauma and adversity perspective to climate change mental health,"The 15 papers included in this special issue represent six major themes drawn from research on traumatic events directly associated with climate change (e.g. hurricanes, floods, wildfires) as well as events associated with other environmental stressors (e.g. earthquakes): (1) the complexity of climate change related mental health outcomes; (2) the impacts of exposure to multiple or simultaneous climate change-related events and stressors; (3) the moderators and mediators of vulnerability to climate change-related mental health outcomes; (4) individual and community resilience and protective factors; (5) the impacts of traumatic forms of climate change on child and adolescent mental health; and (6) the development and implementation of interventions designed to prevent or mitigate these impacts. Together they contribute to trauma and adversity model of the mental health impacts of climate change (Figure 1)."
827,Taking a trauma and adversity perspective to climate change mental health,"The European Journal of Psychotraumatology has had a long interest in advancing the science around climate change and traumatic stress. In this special issue, we include papers that responded to a special call in this area. Six major themes emerge from these papers and together they contribute to trauma and adversity model of the mental health impacts of climate change. We argue that, in addition to individual vulnerability factors, we must consider the (i) cumulative trauma burden that is associated with exposure to ongoing climate change-related impacts; (ii) impact of both direct and indirect stressors; (iii) individual and community protective factors. These factors can then guide intervention models of recovery and ongoing resilience."
828,Deep Learning and Geriatric Mental Health,"Overall, deep learning provides many opportunities and challenges for geriatric mental health care. NIH has identified deep learning as a target research area and describes a new era of data science (https://www.hhs.gov/about/strategic-plan/index.html). Industry (e.g., Meta, Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Netfix) are currently leading research in this area. Thus, academic-industry collaborations will become essential. For many reasons there is growing recognition and concern about the ethics of developing deep learning. There are significant privacy issues in collecting the data, as well as issues around improving the informed consent process to ensure participants are appropriately informed and able to understand what data is being captured, where their data is stored, who has access, and if their data will eventually be sold. A government regulatory framework is being worked out53. There are also emerging ethical concerns in the use of AI54. The way deep learning can make things up with generative AI allows for propagation of misinformation. Continued discussions will benefit from wider understanding of deep learning and its implications."
829,Deep Learning and Geriatric Mental Health,"There is growing literature on deep learning in neuroimaging49. It is being used to identify specific imaging patterns predictive of diagnosis or of treatment response. Deep learning algorithms leverage the large within subject data to synthesize new data that has similar patterns. A growing open-science community specific for machine learning in AI (https://monai.io) makes many of these tools more accessible to the growing research community. In geriatric mental health, this has been particularly effective in identifying accurate models of the aging brain50, dementia51, and response to treatment52."
830,Deep Learning and Geriatric Mental Health,"Researchers have applied deep learning to typing patterns on a smartphone keyboard (not�what�you type, but�how�you type it) in several different neuropsychiatric populations and extracted distinctive keystroke dynamics. Further, these patterns have been found to identify unique typing signatures ? or digital biomarkers ? of cognition and mood. In one study that evaluated over 86,000 typing actions from 147 users (Veset et al), keyboard dynamics data demonstrated that more severe depression was related to more variable typing speed, shorter session duration, and lower typing accuracy. Typing dynamics data has also been shown to predict future changes in mood40�41."
831,Deep Learning and Geriatric Mental Health,"Passive sensing refers to the collection of data from various sensors embedded in everyday devices, such as smartphones and wearables, without requiring any active involvement from the user. It allows for digital phenotyping32. Smartphones, in particular, can be used to continuously collect a wide range of passive sensing data, including accelerometers, gyroscopes, GPS, ambient light sensors, microphones, typing patterns, and more. Using deep learning with passive sensing data allows for the analysis of the ?big data? coming from passive monitors, and for the development of potentially meaningful insights from these passive sensing technologies. Deep learning is particularly well-suited for analyzing passive sensing data due to its ability to automatically learn hierarchical representations from complex and high-dimensional data. Deep learning models can effectively capture patterns, relationships, and dependencies within this data, enabling accurate predictions and insightful analysis. For example, Apple has integrated these tools into its devices to help with health promotion."
832,Deep Learning and Geriatric Mental Health,"The theory of computing, as discussed above, provides a language for discussing psychological theories of mind. Prior theories have touched on related concepts of multiple agent learning or a broader sense of distributed locus of control. Prior uses include the theory of multiple intelligences29�and society of mind30. Marks-Tarlow31�uses the related mathematical language of fractals as a framework for understanding transpersonal psychology. In studying how rules for information processing are followed by computers, our brains, and our minds, we can create transdisciplinary approaches where neuroscience and computational research can inform each other28."
833,Deep Learning and Geriatric Mental Health,"Deep learning can sometimes be approached as black box, where one focuses only on the input and output and ignores what happens in between. A field within deep learning is Representational Learning, which highlights the structure of the internal representation. This is similar to the latent space or principal components that are used to determine model fit in traditional statistics. However, in deep learning, the model uses hundreds of millions of parameters to form the fit. This means that deep learning is capable of finding non-linear combinations of features and the ?deep learning? representation space can therefore exhibit properties seen in complex dynamic systems (like nuclear physics). This can facilitate aspects of deep understanding, perhaps related to meaning and even empathy. In deep learning, when the input features are recoded in particularly complex ways, it is referred to as grokking25. The term comes from the book�Stranger in a Strange Land26�by Robert Heinlein where it refers to deep empathy. Deep Learning may therefore be capable as language that allows exploration of questions of meaning and end of life, often central to geriatric mental health.�27."
834,Deep Learning and Geriatric Mental Health,"The application of the computing theory principles to learning18�is referred to as Computational Learning Theory (COLT)19. In COLT, the generic problem of ?learning? is the focus, and the properties of learning are determined by proving related theorems. Supervised machine learning is defined using parameters to circumscribe performance. An effective learning algorithm should�probably�find an�approximate�rule. This is referred to as the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) formalization of supervised learning20. It assumes a passive sampling of the distribution. Generative AI, on the other hand, allows for the asking of questions and an active sampling of the distribution (See�Table). Thus generative AI adds query learning to the standard example-based learning framework21."
835,Deep Learning and Geriatric Mental Health,"With Deep Learning still a very nascent entity, particularly as it applies to geriatric mental health, there is an opportunity for clinicians and researchers to understand the mathematical foundations of the field. This may support a more sophisticated understanding of the explosion of research in this space that is inevitable. Here, we present a very broad overview of philosophical and historical questions that underlie the evolution of AI. One way to understand machine learning is through the lens of Computing Theory15. These principles describe the inherent limits of information processing. They are used in understanding and developing machine learning approaches. One way to appreciate the contributions of the theory of computing is through its impact on cryptography (i.e. the mathematics of data security)16. The ability to create secure encryption (i.e., recoding in a new language) relies on defining the number of steps needed in an algorithm. If allowed to simply try all examples, deciphering passwords, would be easy. But, the more complex the password, the exponentially higher the number if attempts needed. This number can quickly become unimaginable, even for simple encryption problems. Thus, certain computational problems (like breaking cryptographic codes) are infeasible. However, other tasks such as identifying common patterns, and parsing certain languages can be done efficiently with a circumscribed number of steps."
836,Deep Learning and Geriatric Mental Health,"An exciting recent development has been the use of ?generative? deep learning methods to handle the problem of small sample size. This class of deep learning methods augment (artificially increase) the available training examples by synthesizing new examples from the distribution of the observed examples ? thus increasing the effective sample size on which the deep learning model is trained12. A way of understanding the difference between generative AI and traditional ML is that generative AI is capable of creating new data, whereas traditional ML is limited to identifying patterns and making predictions from existing data only. In essence generative AI leverages large amounts of data, which we have on a small number of people, to learn with fewer examples. This is exemplified in the deep learning approach of few-shot learning�6, which shows how learning can occur with very small sample sizes. In certain ways this can be seen as analogous to how a child is able to learn very deeply what a dog is even from knowing just one dog very well. Similarly, in medical school one can learn anatomy very well from one cadaver. One challenge with generative AI is that it can lead to certain biases in the generated sample. A recent paper showed how large language models, such as ChatGPT, may become biased towards normal appearing data, and lose representation of uncommon events that occur in the tails of the distributions13."
837,Deep Learning and Geriatric Mental Health,"A major challenge in the historical development of artificial neural networks was coming up with a computationally efficient way to modify the weights. The development of back-propagation, helped to make efficient estimation of deep learning models possible and this has led to widespread use of these models in many application areas. For a full description, we refer reader to Chapter 8 of an early classic book in AI and artificial neural networks11."
838,Deep Learning and Geriatric Mental Health,"To illustrate the difference between traditional machine learning and deep learning, consider an analogy in which both methods attempt to learn the concept of ?dog.? Traditional machine learning, like classification and regression trees, can be likened to learning about dogs through a description of their attributes. In this scenario, the algorithm is provided with a list of features such as ?has fur,? ?domesticated,? and ?mammal.? The learner then uses these features to construct a rule. The left panel of�Figure 1�shows a classification tree as an example of a traditional machine learning method. This process involves identifying a pattern within the features that can distinguish which settings for the features defines being a dog. The result is a model capable of classifying an object as a dog based on the presence or absence of these predefined features. While deep learning models can be developed that also use this same list of features to develop a model for classifying an observation as a dog or not a dog, one of the major strengths of deep learning is that such derived feature lists are not necessary to develop a well-performing classifier. (Figure 1)"
839,Deep Learning and Geriatric Mental Health,"Deep learning differs from more traditional machine learning (e.g., logistic regression, random forests, and support vector machines) in several ways. As noted above, deep learning can be described by the complexity of the learner (i.e., depth of the ANN). Therefore, one way in which deep learning models can be distinguished from traditional machine learning models is by their need for a lot of examples."
840,Deep Learning and Geriatric Mental Health,"More and more, unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning techniques are also being utilized. In unsupervised learning, algorithms learn patterns from unlabeled data5. That is, all the variables used in the analysis are used as inputs, thus, the techniques are suitable for creating the labels in the data. For example, unsupervised learning techniques might be used to classify individuals diagnosed with a particular disease into previously unknown subtype classes based on different observed features. Semi-supervised models use a hybrid approach."
841,Deep Learning and Geriatric Mental Health,"Machine learning is a component of the umbrella term artificial intelligence (AI). Artificial intelligence is the overall quest of having computers act intelligently3. Machine learning algorithms are those AI techniques that focus on the intelligent task of learning. In this case, machine learning refers to the process of having a computer find a pattern from seeing positive and negative examples of that pattern. The most common form of machine learning is referred to as supervised learning, because the examples involved include both the features (e.g., clinical, imaging, or demographic characteristics) under consideration for predicting an outcome of interest and the values for that outcome variable. Features can be unprocessed raw observed data, such as the medical image or recorded audio, or it can be fully processed and extracted variables. Examples of processed features that can be used for learning include regional atrophy measures extracted from the MRI or summary behavior rating scores, such as the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale. These features, paired with the observed outcomes, are used to guide the learning process."
842,Deep Learning and Geriatric Mental Health,"The goal of this overview is to help clinicians develop a basic proficiency with the terminology of deep learning, understand its fundamentals and the early applications. We We first describe what machine learning and deep learning represent, Next, we discuss how and why considerations of sample size differ between machine learning and deep learning. Next, we present sections that aim to familiarize readers with foundational mathematical principles that underlie deep learning and touch on how deep learning represents a new tool to help evolve our understanding of complex philosophical principles such as linguistics and theory of mind. Finally we review how early clinical applications are being determined based on deep learning."
843,Deep Learning and Geriatric Mental Health,"When imagined through the lens of data science, geriatric mental health care represents a process of gathering and incorporating a diverse set of streams of data (e.g. behavioral assessments, cognitive evaluation, medical examination, psychosocial context, imaging, genetic, passively sensed, and laboratory tests) and making both situational and longer-term decisions. With the ever-growing availability of tools to support clinical decision-making, the field of geriatric mental health should be seen as a fertile ground for incorporating data processing and predictive analytics into clinical workflow. There are many ways in which advances in computational science may help manage this complexity - from processing brain images to providing in-the-moment access to medical knowledge. The challenge is to develop proficiency in the use of these increasingly sophisticated tools while prioritizing the human aspect of care that is a foundational element of care in older adults1. It is increasingly clear that the future of medical science will require proficiency in the use of a new generation of Artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools, but in order for these tools to achieve their potential, they should be used to augment, rather than replace, the human element of care. A relatively clear way in which this can be accomplished is by using these tools to help clinicians simplify the complexity inherent in late-life mental health care."
844,Deep Learning and Geriatric Mental Health,"The goal of this overview is to help clinicians develop a basic proficiency with the terminology of deep learning and understand its fundamentals and early applications. We describe what machine learning and deep learning represent and explain the underlying data science principles. We also review current promising applications and identify ethical issues that bear consideration. Deep Learning is a new type of machine learning that is remarkably good at finding patterns in data, and in some cases generating realistic new data. We provide insights into how deep learning works and discuss its relevance to geriatric psychiatry."
845,The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms,"Artificial intelligence can efficiently process large amounts of data. In fact, in the previously discussed Valeriani and Simonyan [33] study, the researchers reported that through machine learning techniques, each patient's neuroimaging scan took an average of 0.36�s to process, which is clearly a substantial improvement compared to manual methods. The machine learning algorithms applied in Yao et al. [45] may be extended to clinical and biofluid-based biomarkers. As indicated above, studies have reached higher accuracy when multiple data types are integrated [27?29,35]. This suggests that accuracy may be increased through aggregating different types of biomarkers, and that machine learning models perform better when multiple biomarkers affecting a disease are factored into analysis and prediction. Further, machine learning algorithms that have more layers tend to perform better than shallow pipelines, suggesting that deep neural networks and deep learning algorithms may contribute to the development of diagnostic and predictive biomarkers and increase efficiency [33]. The evidence from recent research suggests that machine learning techniques can be applied to diagnosis, prediction, and biomarker detection in movement disorders and in PD."
846,The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms,"Essential tremor's (ET) causes and disease pathology are still unknown, and studies that aim to determine where dysfunction resides are inconclusive. As machine learning may efficiently determine structural and functional damage, Sacc� et al. [46] aimed to investigate the use of a support vector machine with resting-state fMRI to identify functional differences between ET subjects (n�=�18) and HC (n�=�19). The researchers considered 14 networks that covered the whole brain in differentiating ET and HC. RFE was used to select and rank the networks based on their importance. Ten-fold cross-validation was used to gain a robust estimate of the model performance. The reported AUC was 0.75, with a sensitivity of 70�% and specificity of 40�%, and the four most important networks were the language, primary visual, cerebellar, and attention networks [46]. Based on the sensitivity and specificity values, 12 of 18�ET subjects and 7 of 19 HC were correctly identified (see�Table 3). Bianco et al. [47] differentiated subjects with ET (n�=�33) and subjects with essential tremor from resting tremor (rTR) (n�=�30) from HC (n�=�45). Five-fold cross-validation was used in training, and repeated stratified five-fold cross-validation was used to measure the model performance. 358 features were obtained from the initial feature extraction, but no feature selection methods were used, which may have affected the model performance. However, a feature importance analysis was completed, which indicated that the most important feature for distinguishing ET from rTR and rTR from HC was cortical volume in the left pars opercularis and cortical roughness of the left paracentral lobule, respectfully [47]. The researchers reported that when differentiating rTR and HC, the highest-performing model was derived from cortical roughness. This model achieved an AUC of 0.85���0.09, a sensitivity of 69���20�%, and a specificity of 89���11�% [47]. In comparison, when differentiating rTR and ET subjects, the most accurate model used cortical thickness metrics and achieved an AUC of 0.865���0.11, sensitivity of 78���19�%, and specificity of 83.4���13�% [47]. No models differentiating ET subjects from HC were reported, as the accuracy was less than 80�% (see�Table 3). The research from Sacc� et al. [46] and Bianco et al. [47] supports that machine learning models may contribute to determining the utility of metrics for analysis and differentiation of ET, other APs, and HC."
847,The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms,"The training set used 160 HC and 160 dystonia patients. Two independent test sets were used: one with 60 HC and 60 dystonia patients, and the second with patients who had three types of dystonia (59 laryngeal dystonia; 54 blepharospasm; 59 cervical dystonia). A deep learning pipeline (DystoniaNet) was developed using raw T1-weighted MRI, and features were extracted and selected within this pipeline. The researchers compared DystoniaNet against three shallow pipelines (LDA, SVM, and a one-layer ANN). After generalizability, a test dataset independent of the training data was applied to the DystoniaNet algorithm, which reported an overall accuracy of 98.8�% in diagnosing three types of dystonia and referred 3.5�% of the subjects for further examination. When the three shallow pipelines were applied, AUC, sensitivity, and specificity values were significantly lower compared to the DystoniaNet algorithm. The reported AUC, sensitivity, and specificity values were 0.829, 60.0�%, and 83.3�% for the LDA; 0.812, 65.0�%, and 85.0�% for the SVM; and 0.740, 50.0�%, and 80.0�% for the ANN, respectively. No statistically significant difference between the shallow pipelines? AUCs was reported (see�Table 3) [33]. These results indicate that the complexity of a machine learning pipeline may correlate with model performance."
848,The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms,"These results further support the evidence that the combination of multiple biomarkers from different data sources may contribute towards model performance. As machine learning can efficiently identify information from multiple data sources and can be used to determine which sources of data are useful for a specific comparison, these techniques may be applied to uncover and validate biomarkers for PD."
849,The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms,"Another study investigated the use of subcortical volume (SC volume) and number of streamlines (NOS: a measure of connectivity between areas) derived from tractography in distinguishing MSA�(n�=�31) from PD�(n�=�65) and MSA from HC (n�=�54) [31]. LOOCV was used to avoid overfitting during feature selection, which resulted in 5 features for fractional anisotropy and 6 features for mean diffusivity. The researchers reported that in the MSA-HC comparison, the combination of NOS and SC volume achieved the highest accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity (NOS: accuracy of 79�%, sensitivity of 84�%, specificity of 74�%; SC volume: accuracy of 85�%, sensitivity of 77�%, specificity of 93�%; NOS and SC volume: accuracy of 89�%, sensitivity of 84�%, specificity of 94�%). Meanwhile, in the MSA-PD comparison, the combination of NOS and subcortical volume achieved the same accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity as the subcortical volume-based model (NOS: accuracy of 79�%, sensitivity of 71�%, specificity of 86�%; SC volume: accuracy of 84�%, sensitivity of 74�%, specificity of 94�%; NOS and SC volume: accuracy of 84�%, sensitivity of 74�%, specificity of 94�%) [31]. This research supports that the application of multiple metrics assists in increasing model accuracy (see�Table 3)."
850,The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms,"Archer et al. [30] investigated the use of a machine learning-based model combining free-water (FW) and fractional anisotropy (FA) metrics obtained from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in differentiating APs (n�=�213) from PD (n�=�511), and in differentiating MSA (n�=�84) from PSP (n�=�129). Approximately 80�% of the data was used for the training set, and the other 20�% was used for the test set. In the training process, five-fold cross-validation was implemented. The researchers compared the results from the DWI-based model with a model using the MDS UPDRS III scale, a widely used clinical scale for diagnosing PD. AUC values were significantly higher when using DWI metrics (0.955 and 0.926) compared to the MDS UPDRS III scale (0.775 and 0.582) when distinguishing PD from APs and MSA from PSP, respectively. The researchers additionally created a model combining both DWI and MDS UPDRS III measurements, and both comparisons exhibited increases in AUC for this model compared to the other models (0.962 for PD-APs and 0.897 for MSA-PSP). The PD-APs comparison still displayed a higher AUC value than the MSA-PSP comparison. A feature importance assessment was completed for both comparisons, and the top ten features in both lists included regions pathologically involved in PD [30]. The large differences in the efficacy of the MDS UPDRS III measurements can be in part attributed to the specialization of the MDS UPDRS III scale to PD; additionally, results in DWI may be more similar between MSA and PSP than between PD and APs (see�Table 4) [30]."
851,The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms,"APs such as PSP and MSA share numerous similarities with PD, but a misdiagnosis can be devastating for a patient. As such, the determination of biomarkers to distinguish APs from PD is necessary. Here, we reviewed studies that applied machine learning-based models to differentiate PD from APs (n�=�5)."
852,The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms,"Other studies have also showcased AI's capacity to process multiple data sources in application to PD. Almgren et al. [29] aimed to predict cognitive decline in subjects with PD (n�=�213) when provided with clinical cognitive test scores (including the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)), CSF biomarkers (including tau, and beta-amyloid), neuroimaging-based volumetric data, and genetic variant data. 69 features were initially included; feature selection reduced the number of features to 12 [29]. Ten-fold cross-validation was used while training the model. Statistically significant positive correlations were found between MoCA scores and beta-amyloid (p�=�0.018), while statistically significant negative correlations were found between MoCA scores and baseline cognition (p�=�0.00004), total tau (p�=�0.049), anxiety scores (p�=�0.042), and autonomic dysfunction (p�=�0.005). Additionally, a nearly statistically significant correlation was found between MoCA scores and phosphorylated tau levels (p�=�0.052). The correlations between MoCA scores and beta-amyloid and tau are justifiable, as these proteins are found at abnormal levels in Alzheimer's disease (see�Table 4) [29]."
853,The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms,"Based on the evidence that motor extremities are implicated in PD, studies have analyzed the use of metrics derived from motor extremities to determine disease severity and diagnose PD. Sun et al. [42] explored creating a model that analyzed plantar pressure for this purpose. The proposed mathematical model relied on the separation of the foot into five sub-regions to classify subjects as PD (n�=�93) with mild or moderate severity or HC (n�=�73). Ten-fold cross-validation was used. Feature extraction was done using a dynamics feature extractor (DFE), but the study did not report the number of features used and did not apply feature selection. In comparison to various other recent studies, Sun et al. [42] reported an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 100.00�% in distinguishing PD from HC and an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 95.89�%, 95.00�%, and 97.50�% in classifying disease severity. No confidence interval was reported. The researchers compared combining different machine learning techniques to create the final high-performing model. Based on the metrics reported, performance increased by at least 4�% in PD diagnosis and at least 12�% in the severity assessment when the DFE was applied. Additionally, the metrics reported from the final model outperformed models created in other studies using similar data samples (see�Table 2)."
854,The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms,"Overall, these results seem to support the evidence that combining different biomarkers can improve model performance in diagnosing PD, and that machine learning techniques, including neural networks, can be applied in determining viable biomarkers."
855,The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms,"Some researchers aimed to apply a combination of different biomarkers to achieve high diagnostic capacity. Prashanth et al. [27] explored machine learning's ability to distinguish HC (n�=�183) and PD subjects (n�=�401) early in their progression using REM sleep disorder symptoms, loss of olfactory ability, and SPECT and CSF data. 70�% of the sample data was used to train the models, and the remaining 30�% was used to test the model. This was repeated 100 times with different partitions of training and testing sets, and the average accuracy metrics from the training and testing sets were reported. The researchers found that when an SVM classifier was used, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC values were 96.40�%, 97.03�%, 95.01�%, and 0.9888 in the testing set, respectively. 11 of out 13 features were determined to be statistically significant. Of these features, the most important biomarkers, as reported by Prashanth et al. [27], were the SBR in the putamen and caudate, UPSIT scores, and the total tau/beta-amyloid ratio (see�Table 4)."
856,The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms,"Neuroimaging has frequently been investigated using machine learning techniques. For instance, Gaurav et al. [39] focused on neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra and created an automated artificial intelligence-based framework to segment the substantia nigra and quantify nigral neuromelanin levels and distinguish subjects with PD (n�=�144) from HC (n�=�55). 54 subjects were used as training, and 6 were used for validation. The researchers compared the AUC of the automated segmentation with that of the manual segmentation for the corrected volume, uncorrected volume, normalized signal intensity, and contrast-to-noise ratio. When both the training and testing cohorts were combined, the automated method's AUCs were 0.85, 0.83, 0.79, and 0.77 and the manual method's AUC values were 0.76, 0.74, 0.78, and 0.76, respectively. Despite this, the researchers did not report the AUC values for the testing set alone, which would be the most precise measurements. Based on the figure showing the ROC curves in the training set and in the testing set and the reported AUCs for the training set alone, it could be assumed that the AUCs for the testing set are at least 0.10 less than the AUCs reported for training and testing. Even though the AUCs for the testing set were not reported, the ROC curves for testing show that the automated method performed better than the manual method. From this observation, this study supports that the application of AI and machine learning techniques aids in the determination of neuroimaging-based biomarkers (see�Table 3)."
857,The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms,"One study, which explored keystroke data to determine whether a subject had PD (n�=�88) or was a HC (n�=�30), found that a model using feature selection, which limited the number of features from 378 to 5, combining the most popular features of machine learning algorithms (feature ensemble) provided an accuracy of 91.73�?�100 %. In comparison, a model not using feature selection and combining the results of multiple machine learning algorithms by majority vote (model ensemble) provided accuracy of 81.08�?�100 % [36]. The researchers used leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV), which is a version of�k-fold cross-validation where�k�is the size of the dataset. Therefore, the model was trained 118 times and a different subject's data was used as a test set each iteration. The feature ensemble was shown to have more consistent results across 14 different data samples compared to the model ensemble. This model ensemble used approximately 378 features, and the model accuracy improved to 89.18?97.50�% when the number of features was limited to five. No confidence interval was reported. Both the feature and model ensembles reported sensitivity of 97.73?100�%, and for specificity, the feature ensemble reported 90?96.67�% and the model ensemble reported 96.67?96.67�% [36] (see�Table 2). The disease duration for PD subjects ranged from 0 to 26 years, and the distribution of disease duration was not indicated by the researchers. This model may be most applicable for subjects with late-stage PD."
858,The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms,"As many researchers have shown that ensemble models can perform better than single models, this method may increase efficacy. Additionally, ensemble models increase in accuracy when results from multiple machine learning algorithms are combined [26,33]. In future analyses, machine learning algorithms can be analyzed separately to determine individual potential, and from the high-performing algorithms, an ensemble model can be formed. From this analysis, neural networks and algorithms such as SVM and XGBoost should be applied to identification and differentiation of movement disorders."
859,The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms,"In Chien et al. [26], SVM and NN classifiers were compared in separation of atypical parkinsonisms (APs) and PD using DAT-SPECT imaging. While the NN was trained from imaging directly, the SVM was trained from the striatal bind ratio (SBR) and asymmetry index (metrics obtained from the images). The NN performed much better than the SVM, which may have resulted from the metrics used by the SVM. In most other studies using SVM in application to neuroimaging data, the classification is based on values obtained from imaging, and the classifier does not assess the images themselves [27?33]. This may restrict analysis to certain values or compromise accuracy. One way to avoid this is to use a feature extraction/elimination technique to ensure that the important features are used by SVM [34]. In some models combining machine learning techniques (defined as ensemble models), models for feature extraction, such as PCA and LDA, are combined with classification or regression models, such as SVM and NN, to limit analysis to fewer features."
860,The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms,"Because of issues similar to overfitting caused by numerous features being evaluated, feature extraction can be implemented to reduce the number of features used in later analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique used to reduce dimensionality in data and reduce the number of variables without removing the original information. To achieve this, PCA determines the pair of variables that causes the maximum variance and removes it, then determines a second pair that causes the maximum of the remaining variances and removes it, and repeat. After this procedure, PCA computes the eigenvalues for these pairs, which represent the total amount of variance that can be explained by one of the pairs. The pairs of features that have eigenvalues greater than one are included, while the rest are excluded. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a similar technique in classification problems for two groups that aims to reduce dimensionality and increase separability between groups. Its method of doing this is to maximize the between-group scatter matrix while minimizing the within-group scatter matrix [23]. Recursive feature elimination (RFE) is an iterative method that removes the variable with the lowest rank from the analysis until there are no variables left to sort the variables by utility [24]."
861,The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms,"Support vector machine (SVM) is a machine learning technique which uses data points to determine a nonlinear plane that best separates the data. Due to this mechanism, SVM is primarily used to classify between two different groups, but it has the capacity to discriminate between three or more groups through training separate SVMs [22]. In most classification problems, SVM outperforms linear and logistic regression because it has the capacity to transform data into higher dimensions and separate data in a non-linear plane [17]. SVMs compute the boundary between groups midway between the closest points of the group. While this is useful in small datasets with low dimensionality, such as a small number of features, SVM can be prone to overfitting in with higher dimensionality and larger datasets."
862,The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms,
863,The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms,"The metrics most typically used to assess performance of machine learning models are sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity is defined as the number of positive cases that a diagnostic tool correctly determines to be positive, while specificity is the number of negative cases that a diagnostic tool correctly determines to be negative. Based on prior research on these metrics, a sensitivity or specificity of 70�% is required as minimum for a test to be fairly sensitive or specific, respectively. In comparison, a sensitivity or specificity of 80�% indicates the test has a fairly good sensitivity or specificity [15]. A sensitivity of 100�% indicates that all positive cases are detected by the tool and there are no false negatives, while a specificity of 100�% indicates that all negative cases are detected by the tool and there are no false positives [16]. The adequate sensitivity and specificity values for an analysis must consider the sample size; a smaller sample size requires higher sensitivity/specificity values for the results to be significant and for researchers to conclude that a test performs well. Another metric frequently used is the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). This metric uses various thresholds for the variable being used for classification to determine the sensitivity and specificity. For instance, a threshold of 0 for a variable ranging from 0 to 1 aimed to diagnose PD would result in no subjects being classified as having PD, and therefore a sensitivity of 0�% and specificity of 100�%. By comparison, a threshold of 1 would indicate all subjects were classified as having PD, so the sensitivity would be 100�% and the specificity would be 0�%. Sensitivity and (1-specificity) are plotted to create the receiver operating curve, and the area under this curve can be used to measure the model performance. Because of this mechanism, the AUC can be more accurate than sensitivity and specificity, as multiple iterations are used to calculate the metric."
864,The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms,"Diagnostic accuracy can be often challenging because of the lack of reliable biomarkers. Machine learning may be able to overcome these challenges if proper metrics are applied to interpret the variety of biomarkers, including clinical, neuroimaging, and biofluid-based biomarkers."
865,The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms,"Yet, there is still no standard metric to diagnose PD [8?10]. While no specific neuroimaging method is recommended for routine use, clinical research supports the use of certain pre-synaptic dopaminergic radiotracers to confirm the diagnosis in more challenging and questionable cases [11,12]. However, sometimes neuroimaging scans can be inconclusive on their own, so more reliable methods to increase the capacity of diagnostics for PD are necessary [13,14]."
866,The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms,
867,The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms,"Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative movement disorder associated with motor and non-motor symptoms causing severe disability as the disease progresses. The development of biomarkers for Parkinson's disease to diagnose patients earlier and predict disease progression is imperative. As artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques efficiently process data and can handle multiple data types, we reviewed the literature to determine the extent to which these techniques have been applied to biomarkers for Parkinson's disease and movement disorders. We determined that the most applicable machine learning techniques are support vector machines and neural networks, depending on the size and type of the data being analyzed. Additionally, more complex machine learning techniques showed increased accuracy when compared to less complex techniques, especially when multiple machine learning models were combined. We can conclude that artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques may have the capacity to significantly boost diagnostic capacity in movement disorders and Parkinson's disease."
868,Machine learning and the prediction of suicide in psychiatric populations: a systematic review,"Finally, it is evident the importance of further studies also examining the role of neurocognitive variables, dimensions of social support, loneliness, extent and type of medical comorbidity and associated disability, the type of pharmacological interventions used in the context of specific diagnoses as well as the presence of psychotherapies and their combination with medications on suicidal risk. Similarly, a call for a more consistent use of ML is of paramount importance. CNN, RF, and SVM proved to perform better against other algorithms, but these results should be further tested in the future."
869,Machine learning and the prediction of suicide in psychiatric populations: a systematic review,"In addition, most of the studies addressed the prediction of suicide using a cross-sectional approach, disregarding the temporal aspects. Yet, time may represent a crucial feature for predictive models of suicide [17]. In this regard, defining in advance one or more prediction windows after the assessment is fundamental, as the prediction of short-term suicide risk may rely on different features as compared with long-term risk. Similarly, the temporal characteristics of a feature with respect to the assessment point might impact differentially the accuracy of prediction. For instance, suicide attempts in the year prior to the assessment, but not those that occurred several years before, may be a stronger predictor for new short-time suicidal behaviors."
870,Machine learning and the prediction of suicide in psychiatric populations: a systematic review,"For instance, the decision to use either a specific and unique ML framework or different algorithms should be motivated: the testing of several approaches at once seems confusing and rather exploratory, especially in the absence of an external validation dataset. Regarding the different algorithms, it is noteworthy to mention that, from our results, it emerged that deep learning methods (such as CNN) performed better than other ML algorithms in direct comparisons. Although important from a research point of view, deep learning algorithms tend to be less interpretable (more ?black boxes?), and this aspect might prove crucial in the further development of AI techniques in medicine and psychiatry. This is true, especially in the field of mental health and suicide prediction, where AI tools should assist clinicians and not introduce further complexity. For an AI to become useful in clinical practice, it should prove to be trustworthy, therefore not only valid and reliable, but also easily understandable [107]. In the last years, the concept of explainable AI (?XAI?) emerged, as a possibility to close the gap between the algorithms and the clinicians, creating a human-understandable correspondence between inputs and outputs of the black-box model either through intrinsic transparency of the model or through post-hoc techniques. Given that clinical applications are high-stakes, we require understandability from the prediction tools, or either AI tools will grow in distrust [107]."
871,Machine learning and the prediction of suicide in psychiatric populations: a systematic review,"Lastly, only a few studies employed biological features, such as genes, SNPs, epigenetic loci [42,�43,�98,�106], and neuroimaging measures [47,�49,�53,�68,�69,�79,�81] to predict suicide. Surprisingly, just a single study [53] combined brain imaging with clinical data to predict suicidal behaviors. As one of the major strengths of ML is the possibility to combine data obtained through different modalities (e.g., genetics, brain imaging, clinical features) to increase prediction accuracy, this approach should be exploited in future suicide research, since it is already occurring in other field of medicine [14]."
872,Machine learning and the prediction of suicide in psychiatric populations: a systematic review,"Notably, in most of the cases, the variables employed as predictors were clinical and sociodemographic [48,�57,�87]. Several of the strongest predictors in ML studies are well-known risk factors for suicide, such as previous suicide attempts, previous hospitalizations, and severity of depression [28,�38,�51,�89,�91,�94,�96,�99]. Moreover, the presence of psychosis and a higher amount of pharmacological treatments, especially antipsychotics, resulted to be highly predictive features in many investigations [4,�63,�64,�91,�100,�101]. Interestingly, also presence of psychiatric comorbidities was one of the most valuable predictive features, in particular substance or alcohol use disorders [57,�61,�71,�72,�92]. These results emphasize the importance of a comprehensive evaluation of psychiatric patients and of the burden that comorbidities represent, also given their frequent occurrence [102]. This is particularly important for the comorbid use of alcohol and drug abuse, since they can reduce compliance to treatments [103] and increase impulsive behaviors [104], which in turn may act as risk factors for suicide. Besides the well-known suicide risk factors (i.e., history of suicide attempts, hospitalizations, etc.), more subtle risk factors emerged from the reviewed studies. More in detail, comorbidities resulted in important features in different studies, suggesting that not only psychiatric comorbidities but also physical health is important. Similarly, the use of specific drugs (i.e., antipsychotics), illness severity, and psychosis seemed to be highly predictive of suicide attempts. Finally, some studies suggested that also laboratory tests, such as thyroid hormones, might play a role in predicting suicidal behaviors, even at a subclinical level [51,�83]."
873,Machine learning and the prediction of suicide in psychiatric populations: a systematic review,"Regarding our results, most studies classified lifetime suicide attempts, and fewer assessed suicidal attempts in a follow-up time window [28?32,�38,�39,�96]. Moreover, some studies classified their sample for death by suicide [44], suicidal ideation [45,�46,�48?51,�56,�57], or risk stratification [38,�41,�65?69]. Differences in the outcomes and in the definition of risk pose a problem for the interpretation of the results, as risk factors for suicide are reported to be different from those for self-harm and suicidal ideation [1,�97]. In addition, studies also varied in terms of sample selection. Indeed, while most of the publications assessed suicide as a transdiagnostic outcome [38,�40,�63,�66,�67,�81,�98], only a few authors focused on patients with a specific diagnosis, mostly mood disorders [46,�51,�53,�58,�68,�75,�89,�92]. These differences limit the translation of the findings into clinical practice. Prediction models will likely improve prediction accuracy and inform clinical decisions if tailored not just for specific diagnostic groups but also on a dimensional approach to psychiatric disorders [16], as every diagnosis has a different and specific type of assessment and disease trajectory. This means that different patients? groups might have different predictive features, with probable overlaps between diagnoses. Therefore, a focus on specific diagnostic groups should not divert attention from a comprehensive evaluation of the patient, given that both physical and psychiatric (especially substance abuse disorder) comorbidities proved among the most important predictive features."
874,Machine learning and the prediction of suicide in psychiatric populations: a systematic review,"In studies that involved a broader spectrum of diagnoses of mood disorders (including MDD, BD and also anxiety disorders), previous history of suicide or suicidal thoughts [56,�63], presence of psychotic features [63,�91], and socio-occupational functioning [56,�63,�65] ranked among the most important features in the prediction (all scoring above 70% accuracy). Lastly, Passos and colleagues [91] showed a significant contribution of substance use or dependence and of the number of previous hospitalizations to suicide risk, whereas Iorfino and colleagues [63] found that treatment with antipsychotics, sex, and age were relevant features in the prediction. A brief summary of the most important features is reported in Supplementary Table�5."
875,Machine learning and the prediction of suicide in psychiatric populations: a systematic review,"Regarding the studies that assessed the predictive power of brain imaging data, the thickness and volume of the orbitofrontal, the anterior and posterior cingulate, and the temporal areas were selected by the algorithm as best predictors of suicide attempts in a group of young individuals and MDD patients [53], while in late-life depression sample, frontal areas and precuneus emerges as the strongest predictors [58]. Moreover, measures of functional connectivity [69] of frontolimbic [79,�81] and fronto-temporal circuits, as well as of the default mode network (DMN) [54,�68,�81], the amygdala, the parahippocampus and the putamen [54,�81], attained classification accuracies above 70%."
876,Machine learning and the prediction of suicide in psychiatric populations: a systematic review,"In line with this result, other ML studies highlighted the importance of socio-occupational status and well-being [56,�63,�65,�87,�93]. Similarly, non-psychiatric health issues have been reported among the features able to predict suicide [38,�56,�94]; moreover, one study reported the use of commonly prescribed opioids (e.g., Fentanyl) as a relevant feature in the prediction [57]."
877,Machine learning and the prediction of suicide in psychiatric populations: a systematic review,"Interestingly, 87% of studies (i.e., 54 out of 62) focusing on either prediction accuracy or AUC reported values above 70% or 0.70, respectively. Specifically, eleven studies reported an accuracy between 70 and 80%, 14 between 80 and 90%, and six studies above 90%. Regarding AUC, 14 studies showed AUC between 0.70 and 0.80, 16 between 0.80 and 0.90, and eleven studies reported AUC above 0.90. The AUC of selected studies is reported in Fig.�2�as a function of sample sizes and number of features. Nonetheless, besides a few notable exceptions [38,�42,�43], no studies tested their prediction on independent validation samples. However, it is noticed that in highly unbalanced samples, the lack of an independent validation sample greatly reduces the overall generalizability. Therefore, these findings are likely to suffer from overfitting and should be regarded with caution [85]."
878,Machine learning and the prediction of suicide in psychiatric populations: a systematic review,"Only four studies (4.9%) focused on genetics and epigenetics features in order to predict suicide, and a single study [46] explored the predictive value of the human metabolome, employing 123 plasma metabolites, to predict suicide. Lastly, three studies [36,�51,�83] used blood biochemistry in association with clinical and sociodemographic data."
879,Machine learning and the prediction of suicide in psychiatric populations: a systematic review,"As far as the feature types are concerned, the majority of the studies (54, 66.6%) used clinical and sociodemographic variables. Among these, ten studies were based on electronic health records (EHR), which are becoming an important source of data in the last few years [78]."
880,Machine learning and the prediction of suicide in psychiatric populations: a systematic review,"Finally, among studies focusing on a single diagnosis, MDD was the most represented one (16 times), followed by BD, schizophrenia, and substance-use disorders represented three times each."

More in detail, twelve studies (14.8%) enrolled less than 100 participants, 27 studies (33.3%) enrolled between 100 and 500 individuals, 12 studies (14.8%) between 500 and 1000, 15 studies (18.5%) between 1000 and 10,000 and the remaining ten studies (12.3%) more than 10,000 subjects.

897,Machine learning and the prediction of suicide in psychiatric populations: a systematic review,"In the last few years, several algorithms and procedures have been used to predict suicidal behaviors in different populations [11,�15?17]. Given that suicide is considered a transdiagnostic feature, a number of studies have been conducted in the general population, sometimes with very large and heterogeneous samples [6,�18]. One of the most solid findings emerging from studies focusing on the general population is that a formal psychiatric diagnosis is a strong predictor of suicidal risk in different samples across countries [1,�6,�18,�19]. This is not surprising, as up to 90% of all suicides occur in psychiatric populations [1,�20?22], with mood disorders being considered the leading cause of suicidality among mental disorders [23,�24]."

920,Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health,"Employing appropriate methods to capture microbiome: Most of the studies investigating the causal impact of the microbiome on host health utilise 16?S rRNA gene sequencing to capture the residents in the gut environment. Although metabarcoding approaches are cost effective and comprise of well-established pipelines that are less computationally intensive, they drastically reduce the degree of granularity required in understanding the key microbial members and functional underpinnings of the microbiome along with their influence on host health (Shankar, 2017). In fact, immunological responses towards microbes are highly tailored at a strain level, as also seen with metabolism of xenobiotics (Anderson and Bisanz, 2023), thereby justifying the need for greater degree of resolution offered by shotgun�metagenomics�techniques. Metatranscriptomic and�metaproteomic�techniques are increasingly being used to identify the genes expressed by the microbial community and proteins produced as a consequence of a given microbiota-targeted intervention. Though these techniques are computationally expensive and difficult to integrate into traditional microbiome analytic pipelines, they are increasingly being recognised as the way forward in understanding the functional potential of the gut microbiome."
921,Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health,"Measuring fermented�food intake:�One of the challenges in employing fermented foods as a supplementation strategy in human studies is to accurately and conveniently quantify intake, especially when participants are asked to increase their fermented food consumption. This is a challenge when patients are recommended to incorporate a diverse range of fermented foods with their diet as opposed to single food/beverage, which can be consumed as an entire serving. Non-invasive methods of measuring dietary adherence by the participant include employment of 24-hour food recall (Karbownik et al., 2022a,�Karbownik et al., 2022b), food diaries and�food frequency questionnaires�that are geared towards capturing the diverse nature of fermented foods (Taylor et al., 2020,�Li et al., 2020). These methods are often disadvantaged by not being all-encompassing, subject to respondent fatigue, limited to human memory (Das et al., 2022) but are low cost and easy in their employment, thereby being commonly used for reporting the consumption of fermented food (Ribeiro et al., 2022). Fermented food frequency questionnaires (FFQ?s) must also be tailored to different environments to account for ethnic/racial minorities and must accommodate various culturally distinct populations so as to accurately capture their consumption. The information provided by FFQ can be supplemented with other methods of measuring dietary intake, albeit their respective shortcomings of being logistically and economically difficult to implement. These methods include: evaluation of biomarkers in plasma and urine, digitalised assessment of dietary compliance via food images and smart phone applications that capture the food intake."
922,Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health,"Human studies aiming to understand the impact of microbiota-targeted therapy need to consider a few key points that are discussed in this section, which can add value with respect to investigating the impacts of fermented food consumption on microbiota-gut-brain axis communication."
923,Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health,"Another feature that has a driving influence in shaping fermented food microbiota is the type of substrate that constitutes the fermented food. Various substrate categories of fermented foods are highlighted in�Table 1. An extensive study on fermented food showed dominance of LAB in brine,�Acetobacter�in sugar-based fermented foods and similarities in the microbiotas across dairy based fermented food (Leech et al., 2020). The driving influence of substrate on fermented food microbiome has been shown to also be reflected in the community composition profiles of naturally fermented milk samples, namely koumiss, which differed in the type of milk used (Zhong et al., 2016). Similar observations were made in a study analysing the effect of different sugar substrates in the production of Argentinean kefir (Gamba et al., 2021) and�fermented meat products�obtained from the Inuit community (Campbell et al., 2022). Preparatory conditions such as duration of fermentation, fermentation salinity, pH (L�lf et al., 2021) and�moisture content�(Chen et al., 2023) also influence the microbiome of fermented food. Processing conditions such as ripening time influences the microbial community present in fermented food (rezac et al., 2018,�Jingkai et al., 2020), and these changes were attributed to lowering of the pH and changes in the active enzymes present in the fermented food. In the case of one such example, Taga cheese showed a gradual lowering of mesophilic and psychotropic bacteria at the end of the ripening process. This was accompanied by an increase in the levels of yeasts and moulds along with a gradual increase in�long chain fatty acids�(Criste et al., 2020). Shaping of the microbial community by such environmental factors manifest also into shaping the functional capabilities of food, with certain food substrates and fermentation production practices enriching for the presence of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs)(Du et al., 2023). BGCs are increasingly being studied for their ability to produce specialised metabolites that can influence the health of the host. All of these factors could be exploited in the manufacturing process to coincide with harvest times when foods possess the greatest bioactive potential."
924,Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health,"In general, observational studies relating to the consumption of fermented dairy products on the gut microbiome mirrored longitudinal intervention based human studies (Tessier et al., 2021,�Le Roy et al., 2022,�Suzuki et al., 2017). Observational studies that analysed the consumption of a broad collection of fermented food in participants showed a clear separation of gut microbiota profiles between consumers and non-consumers, along with lowered anxiety in the former (Taylor et al., 2020,�Hilimire et al., 2015a,�Karbownik et al., 2022b). Moreover, observational studies investigating the impact of fermented soy-based products such as tofu,�tempeh,�miso,�natto�and�soy sauce�revealed that higher consumption of soy-based products correlated with better cognitive function in women (Nakamoto et al., 2018b) and was also associated with attenuation of age-associated memory (Porras-Garc�a et al., 2023) and cognitive decline (Lin et al., 2018). The�isoflavone�components of fermented�soy products�can exert oestrogen-like protective effects and may contribute to the neuromodulatory effects of fermented soy-based products in women (Nakamoto et al., 2018a). Studies have also have reported negative consequences associated with the consumption of tofu, which is implicated in worse cognitive outcomes in several cross sectional observational studies (Xu et al., 2015,�Hogervorst et al., 2008a,�White et al., 2000). It has been hypothesised that the formaldehyde used in the production of tofu for maintaining freshness could cause oxidative damage thereby contributing to cognitive decline (Hogervorst et al., 2008a). When we look at meta-analysis on microbiota targeted intervention strategies on global cognition, fermented food based intervention strategies revealed a greater degree of promise than prebiotics and probiotics. The study also reported no significant alteration in memory by prebiotics, probiotics and fermented food intervention (Marx et al., 2020). The study attributed these findings to heterogeneity in cognitive tasks included in the analysis and studies being under-powered to test a hypothesis, in addition to an overall lack of studies (N?=?22) that are geared towards understanding the impact of microbiota-targeted interventions with cognitive readouts."
925,Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health,"Preclinical models used to study the modulation of microbiota-gut-brain axis by fermented foods typically include drosophila, zebrafish, murine and porcine models. Each of these models possess different advantages ranging from being high throughput to having a gut anatomy that resembles that of humans, thereby increasing the likelihood that beneficial impacts, if observed, could be translated.�Fermented dairy products�have been studied most extensively using these preclinical approaches. Indeed, different fermented dairy products have impacted the gut�microbiome, microbial metabolites, inflammatory profile and behavioural phenotypes, resulting in distinct variations compared to normal controls. Behaviourally, administration of specific fermented dairy products has resulted in attenuated anxiety (Oh et al., 2020,�Han et al., 2020) and depressive-like (Van De Wouw et al., 2020,�Chen et al., 2021c) phenotypes and improved performance in memory associated tasks (Van De Wouw et al., 2020,�Van De Wouw et al., 2021,�Liu et al., 2020a). These studies have also reported, in some but not all instances, differences between the microbial communities of groups administered fermented food and those that were administered unfermented controls (Han et al., 2020,�Van De Wouw et al., 2020,�Van De Wouw et al., 2021). Fermented�soy�foods in the forms of tofu,�tempeh,�miso, fermented�soy milk,�natto�and chungkookjang were the next most extensively studied food in pre-clinical models. Fermented soy-based products were found to alter the gut microbiome at family level, modulate the levels of various molecular messengers involved in maintenance of permeability (Chen et al., 2020a,�Singh et al., 2021,�Dai et al., 2019), raise the level of�anaerobes�(Bedani et al., 2010) and improve intestinal integrity (Kawahara et al., 2015,�Jeong et al., 2020a). Notably with respect to this review, the studies also revealed that interventions with fermented soy were associated with significant improvements in memory (Kridawati et al., 2016,�Woo et al., 2016b,�Go et al., 2016,�Yang et al., 2015). Fermented sugar-based products such as�kombucha�and other fruit juices have shown the ability to improve exploratory behaviour, hippocampal memory as well as reinforce intestinal barrier by increasing the levels of SCFA, tight junction proteins and lowering expression of inflammatory cytokines (Cataldo et al., 2020,�Chen et al., 2019,�Pakravan et al., 2019,�Zorraqu�n-Pe�a et al., 2021,�Hartmann et al., 2000). The longest duration of an intervention involved the administration of a specific wine to�mice�for 28 weeks, which resulted in attenuation of cognitive decline. Importantly, the effects of alcohol were accounted for through the use of an ethanol control. They reported no difference in behavioural tests (Barnes maze) and amyloid plaque formation pattern between control and ethanol controls, indicating the neurological benefit of wine was independent of alcohol percentage (Wang et al., 2006). Other substrate categories include diverse fermented plant products such as fermented seaweed, fermented peanut meal, fermented Chinese herbs such as�C. lanceolata,�spirulina maxima�and rice peptides, which have shown improvements in learning and memory in�murine models�(Reid et al., 2018b,�Ding et al., 2021,�Weon et al., 2014,�Corpuz et al., 2019,�Choi et al., 2018)."
926,Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health,"In other instances, it would seem that the beneficial impacts are not attributable to a single strain but rather a combination of factors, including the introduction of multiple microbes, metabolites and substrates that confer benefit to the host. This was evident in mice receiving fermented barley juice, which resulted in an altered faecal metabolomic profile in a manner that was distinct from the group receiving�Lactobacillus plantarum�alone (Zhu et al., 2021). It should be noted that the ability of fermented foods to shape the gut microbiome in preclinical models does not necessarily translate to human studies (Nguyen et al., 2015,�Hugenholtz and De Vos, 2018). To address this, many studies have explored the impact of fermented foods on the gut microbiome in humans. For instance, observational studies reveal high alpha gut microbiome diversity in Korean participants who habitually consumed high amounts of fermented legumes,�fermented vegetables, tea, seaweed and nuts (Noh et al., 2021). Similarly, self-reported fermented food consumption patterns in 130 participants from northern Spain also revealed that fermented�dairy consumption�correlated with higher levels of�Akkermansia�and low levels of�Bacteroides�with concurrent high levels of SCFA such as propionate and butyrate, a pattern that was also observed among cheese consumers when compared to non-consumers (Gonz�lez et al., 2019). Greater beta diversity has been seen in regular fermented food consumers than occasional consumers with the former displaying higher proportions of�Faecalibacterium prausnitzii,�Prevotella�spp,�Pseudomonas�spp,�Clostridiales,�Enterobacteriaceae, Lachnospiraceae�and�Bacteroides spp�(Taylor et al., 2020). On the other hand, the effects of fermented foods on gut microbiome diversity are inconsistent between intervention and observational study designs with studies reporting little to no change in the diversity metric after intervention with fermented food (Alvarez et al., 2020,�Berding et al., 2023,�Le Roy et al., 2022,�Gonz�lez et al., 2019). The conflicting nature of these studies could be attributed to the gut microbiome being predominantly resistant to change over time (Faith et al., 2013). It could also be due to the study duration being too short to capture subtle changes, diverse nature of fermented foods being incorporated into the study design, high degree of interindividual-variability of baseline gut microbiome amongst participants warranting need for crossover studies with sufficient washout period. Other factors include studies employing 16?S rRNA gene sequencing as opposed to shotgun�metagenomics�sequencing, thereby lacking species and further strain level resolution that can significantly contribute towards understanding the subtle changes in microbiota composition along with variation in functional capabilities of microbiome."
927,Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health,"It is to be noted that sex is a critical factor that can influence the composition of the gut microbiome (Bridgewater et al., 2017). Studies exploring the sex-selective effects on gut microbiome composition have been conflicting, and this may be due to small sizes of study population,�body mass index, xenobiotic use, diverse dietary patterns, pathological condition, inconsistencies in tools and pipelines employed to study microbiota composition, diverse ethnicities and strains of models employed in preclinical studies (Kim et al., 2020). The aforementioned factors influence the gut microbiome to a greater effect than sex in humans (Kolde et al., 2018,�Jaggar et al., 2020,�Lloyd-Price et al., 2017). Murine models, however, seem to show a much more pronounced difference in gut microbiota profile than human studies (Mcgee and Huttenhower, 2021), which has led to differential responses to dietary intervention strategies (Bridgewater et al., 2017). Considering this sexual dimorphic nature of the gut microbiota, a recent study of dietary fibre supplementation for 20 weeks to mice revealed sex-specific responses in the gut microbiome and faecal�metabolome. Female mice on a high inulin-based diet showed increased abundance of Bacteroidota and a decline in Faecalibaculum and�Lactococcus, the latter of which is exaggerated in diets rich in dietary fibre (Lloyd-Price et al., 2017). The sexually dimorphic nature of the microbiota in mice along with the differences in the gonadal hormone profile results in a distinct�humoral response. As a result, there is a marked increase in genes pertaining to inflammation in the hippocampus and hypothalamus profile in a sex-specific manner when subjected to probiotic intervention (Yahfoufi et al., 2023). Fermented foods being a possible source of prebiotics and probiotics, as previously described, have resulted in a sex-selective response�(Murray et al., 2019). Therefore, preclinical murine models should be controlled for sex-selective variations in the gut microbiome and downstream immunological profiles."
928,Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health,"The gut microbial community produces metabolites that can modulate host health and reinforce/reduce the integrity of the intestine and BBB thereby modulating the levels of pro-inflammatory triggers reaching systemic circulation and eventually the brain. It is therefore important to understand the impact of fermented food on the intestinal milieu and intestinal health, as they continuously relay information to the peripheral immune system, enteric and�central nervous system."
929,Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health,"Preclinical murine models have addressed this topic by showing a reduction in plasma ghrelin levels post-intervention with fermented goat and cow milk and mixed results with respect to impacts on plasma leptin and�adiponectin�levels (Diaz-Castro et al., 2017,�Mu�oz Alf�rez et al., 2020). Moreover, rats receiving a fermented whey beverage alongside a high-fat diet showed no difference in leptin and ghrelin profiles, despite a decrease in�food intake, compared to high-fat diet controls (Hong et al., 2015). Some studies have included unfermented controls and have reported a greater reduction in serum leptin (Lu et al., 2021) and ghrelin levels (Liu et al., 2019a) upon consuming the fermented counterparts. Such reports serve as an important reminder to interpret other studies that lack critical controls with caution, so as to prevent inflating the potential health benefits associated with fermented food intake. A number of human studies have tried to ascertain if the satiating effects of fermented food are due, at least partially, to protein content. In one randomised�crossover study, the diets of participants were supplemented with fermented and unfermented tempeh (protein control) for a period of two weeks. The group receiving the fermented product showed a reduction in circulating acyl-ghrelin levels by 30% with concurrent reduction in circulating insulin compared to unfermented controls (Noer et al., 2021,�Diaz-Castro et al., 2017). Other clinical studies have reported varied gastric hormone responses depending on the fermented product consumed. The effects have ranged from an increase in ghrelin after moderate beer consumption without changes in leptin levels (Beulens et al., 2008) to almost no differences in the level of leptin and ghrelin release amongst different fermented dairy products (Hansson et al., 2020) and no effect on�sensation�of satiety post-intervention with�red wine�despite lowering of plasma ghrelin levels (Ismail et al., 2022). These results provide evidence of the highly individualistic enteric hormone release profiles towards the consumption of fermented foods along with potential involvement of other pathways/gut hormones, in driving satiation."
930,Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health,"Human studies often adopt self-reported questionnaires to gauge the effect of intervention strategy on satiety and hunger. In humans, fermented dairy, fermented dairy alternates and fermented bread are predominantly studied for their ability to modulate satiety in the individual, but only a few studies investigated circulating GLP profiles. For example, consumption of�sourdough bread�by Swedish adults resulted in pronounced satiety compared to consumption of unfermented whole�grain�and yeast fermented controls. However, the effects of sourdough on insulin release and satiety has not been replicated in two other clinical trials (Shah et al., 2020,�Iversen et al., 2018). The GLP-1 release profiles across all the cohorts were unaffected, suggesting fermented foods enhance satiety via mechanisms independent of GLP-1 (Zamaratskaia et al., 2017). Apart from sourdough, high levels of�vinegar�supplementation has been associated with increased satiety and lower postprandial�blood glucose�(Ostman et al., 2005). Researchers have hypothesised that the satiating effect of�vinegar�and some sourdough could be due to the acid content of the fermented product. The inconsistent results observed on satiety profiles across studies could be attributed to factors such as sex, sample size, duration of intervention, method of sourdough preparation (including species and strain level differences) and quantity of sourdough consumed (Ribet et al., 2023)."
931,Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health,"The�enteroendocrine cells�(EEC) receive multiple stimuli ranging from nutrients, toxins and microorganisms present in fermented and unfermented food and respond by releasing peptides and hormones. Modulating the levels of GLP-1 is being used to attain improved glucose homoeostasis (Yadav et al., 2013) as well as to target obesity (Aldawsari et al., 2023) resulting in the development of wide array of GLP-1 analogues aimed at managing obesity (Dailey and Moran, 2013) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (Maselli and Camilleri, 2021). Dietary intervention strategies are also being employed to target circulating levels of GLP-1 peptides in patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (Di Mauro et al., 2021) and abdominal obesity (Fuglsang-Nielsen et al., 2021). This recent exploration in the use of dietary strategies to combat type 2 diabetes mellitus has resulted in the identification of microbial metabolites, predominantly�SCFA�that can improve production of GLP-1 and peptide YY, both of which are implicated in regulation of insulin release. (Zhao et al., 2018). Fermented foods as a potential source of prebiotics and probiotics to shape the gut microbiota and its metabolites are also being explored to manipulate the levels of gastric peptides that are implicated in satiation and insulin release (Manaer et al., 2015,�Fallah et al., 2018)."
932,Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health,"Despite these developments, there remains a shortage of human studies that have extensively explored the involvement of fermented foods in modulating the serotonergic landscape. In one instance, daily consumption of a fermented�milk product�containing�Lactobacillus casei�for 8 weeks showed increased faecal serotonin and decreased abdominal discomfort without changes in serum�tryptophan,�kynurenine, salivary cortisol and IgA levels compared to participants receiving unfermented controls (Kato-Kataoka et al., 2016). Other studies on�white wine�consumption have shown lowered myogastric electrical activity, variation in plasma serotonin and dopamine profiles (Boyer et al., 2004,�Levanon et al., 2002). Peripherally produced serotonin cannot cross the BBB but downstream metabolic products of tryptophan metabolism can cross the BBB and influence neurological state of the host. In recent years, research has been dedicated towards understanding the effects of tryptophan metabolism, especially the�kynurenine pathway, on host behaviour and health. A meta-analysis of�prebiotic�and probiotic supplementation on tryptophan metabolism revealed significant decrease in kynurenine and kynurenine:tryptophan ratio with probiotic supplementation (Purton et al., 2021). Indeed,�metabolomic�analyses of fermented foods have revealed that they are reservoirs for tryptophan metabolites (Y?lmaz and G�kmen, 2020), revealing that it could be interesting to see how peripheral supplementation of tryptophan metabolites can affect mood and behaviour modulated by the gut microbiota."
933,Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health,"The�enterochromaffin cells�in the intestine are major producers of serotonin (Lund et al., 2018). Gut-derived serotonin is shaped by host diet (Bruta et al., 2021,�Horn et al., 2022), baseline microbiota composition (Reigstad et al., 2015a,�Yano et al., 2015,�Hata et al., 2017) and microbial metabolites produced as a consequence (Reigstad et al., 2015a,�Yano et al., 2015). Although serotonin cannot pass the BBB, it can influence fundamental aspects of the gastric system, such as regulating secretion, motility and tonicity. There are a growing number of studies focusing on the influence of fermented foods on serotonin secretion with special emphasis on�tryptophan�metabolites. Tryptophan metabolites are critical precursors for serotonin and�melatonin�biosynthesis and also lead to the production of indole and kynurenine-related metabolites, all of which are increasingly being appreciated for their neuroactive role in addition to maintaining gut health."
934,Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health,"In murine models, the impact of the HPA axis on various behavioural parameters such as appetite, aversion and cognition are studied by using a multitude of tests such as forced suspension, and immobilisation (despair related behaviour), sucrose water preference (depression-like behaviour), elevated plus maze (anxiety-like behaviour) and startle reflex (responsiveness) and many others (Packard et al., 2016). Consumption of fermented foods including red bean�tempeh, cheese and fermented plant (Laminaria japonica) as assessed by murine models, was shown to reduce anxiety-like behaviours and�corticosterone�levels when subjected to stress (Chen et al., 2020a,�Chen et al., 2021b,�Fourman et al., 2021a,�Jung et al., 2020). Similar attenuations in depression and anxiety-like phenotype accompanied by lowered plasma corticosterone and inflammatory markers such as NF- ?b, TNF-� and IL-6 were observed in the colon of mice supplemented with fermented�ginseng�extract for a period of 5 days (Han et al., 2020). In a comparable manner, fermented porcine placenta supplementation for a 21-day period, which showed lowered cortisol along with creatinine kinase and lactate. The study also showed concurrent lowering of circulating cytokines- IL-6, TNF-�, IL-1?, IL-4 and IFN-? (Kim et al., 2016). All of the mentioned studies report a strong interplay between the immune system and the HPA axis. A potential mechanism by which fermented foods are able to modulate cortisol release could be via blunting the response peripheral immune challenge by causing a reduction in circulating cytokines and other inflammatory markers which are responsible for activating neuronal projectionsinto the PVN (Bellavance and Rivest, 2014). Interestingly, a study on mice subjected to restraint stress and receiving milk kefir treatment, reported the probiotic containing fermented food was able to block HPA axis dysregulation by attenuating the altered expression of�glucocorticoid receptors�in the PVN, when compared to mice receiving unfermented milk. The study also hinted at the HPA axis dysregulation to be highly sex specific and a potential connection between IL-6 and glucocorticoid receptor expression (Smith et al., 2021). Such interesting exploratory efforts could shape our understanding of the multifaceted role played by fermented foods in modulating the microbiota-gut-immune-brain axis."
935,Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health,"Importantly, some of the aforementioned findings relating to the immunomodulatory effects of fermented foods have translated to human studies, albeit only a few studies have also concurrently looked at the gut microbiome profile. For instance, in a study conducted with healthy volunteers, a 10-week fermented food-based intervention resulted in decreased circulating cytokine levels, especially IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12b, along with a concurrent reduction of activation proteins from 4 major immune cell types: CD4+, CD8+, T and B cells (Wastyk et al., 2021). The study also revealed a correlation between faecal�butyrate�and lower circulating B cells (Wastyk et al., 2021), mirroring the preclinical findings of an interplay between microbial metabolite and host immune status. Furthermore, a reduction in circulating cytokine levels such as IL-4, IL-10, IL-12 and MCP-1 was observed in IBS patients supplemented with kimchi for a period of 12 weeks (Kim et al., 2022a). This is however not replicated in other studies that have looked at the impact of fermented, unfermented and�pickled vegetables�for 6 weeks (Galena et al., 2022). The study showed no difference in their serum C - reactive protein (CRP) and TNF-� profile, when measured at the end of the intervention. Similarly, a fermented food enriched diet, when administered for a duration of 4 weeks, did not show any alteration in serum cytokines (Berding et al., 2023).�Epidemiological studies�have also revealed no associations between the consumption of fermented and unfermented dairy with circulating CRP levels (Voutilainen et al., 2022). It is therefore surprising that a recent meta-analysis on�fermented dairy products�such as yogurt, fermented milk and kefir revealed lowered CRP and elevated IFN-? with no significant effect on IL-12, IL-10 and IL-6 (Zhang et al., 2023). It is clear that the effects of fermented foods on circulatory inflammatory cytokines cannot be generalised given the varied responses observed with intervention strategies. A potential reason for this could be due to the heterogeneity of food substrates and microorganisms present in the fermented food and duration of the dietary intervention. The immunological response observed is highly tailored to the fermented food that is being studied and could be influenced by the microbial community it hosts (Spindler et al., 2022) and is addressed in greater detail in the final section of the review. It is also to be acknowledged that sex plays a critical role in modulating microbiota-gut-brain-immune axis communication (Jaggar et al., 2020,�Klein and Flanagan, 2016). Some studies have only looked at fermented food supplementation in male (Schoen et al., 2009,�Bourrie et al., 2023) and female volunteers (Han et al., 2015,�Galena et al., 2022). One study, however, examined sex differences on moderate beer consumption and observed that women had higher CD3+�counts than male volunteers, with both groups showing an overall reduction in the IFN-?/IL-10 ratio when compared to their baseline abstinent phase (Romeo et al., 2007). However, there is a general dearth of human studies that explore sex-selective immunomodulatory responses associated with the consumption of fermented foods and its effects on the overall health of the individual."
936,Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health,"Beyond their influence on barriers, fermented foods are also studied with respect to their role on central/peripheral�immunomodulation. Preclinical studies assessing the impact of fermented foods on the immune system have either studied effects on the baseline unperturbed immunological state of the host or when the host is subjected to an immune challenge that mimics a pathological condition. For instance with respect to the latter,�Lactobacillus delbrueckii�and�Streptococcus�thermophilus�fermented yogurt supplementation in a recurrent model of IBD in murine models, decreased levels of�TLR4?+?and IL-17 along with elevation of IL-10 and�TLR9?+?cells in the colon (Chaves et al., 2011). Similar reductions in the levels of inflammatory cytokines, especially IFN-? and TNF-�, were observed in the colon of mice receiving milk�kefir�post-infection with�Giardia�intestinalis�(Franco et al., 2013). These effects could be due to the ability of some kefirs to upregulate mRNA levels of IL-17 and downregulate IL-6, TNF-�, and IFN-? when subjected to immune challenge in mice (Acurcio et al., 2020). Moreover, repeated treatment with other milk kefirs in mice has been shown to increase levels of�Treg�and IL-10 cells coupled with an attenuation of the elevated�neutrophils�and�CXCL1�levels induced by the stress of repeated oral gavage (Van De Wouw et al., 2020). Further studies have highlighted that this potential peripheral immunomodulation observed in kefir could be attributed to IgA-stimulating�Lactobacillus kefiri�that�reduces expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the mesenteric�lymph nodes�and increases anti-inflammatory cytokines, CXCL-1 and expression of mucin-6 genes. Other strains of the same species were also associated with a lowered expression of IL-6 in the ileum and colon post-LPS exposure (Carasi et al., 2015). It should be noted that studies focusing on a single strain isolated from fermented food aid in the discovery of potential�probiotic�strains and can give insights into the mechanisms via which a fermented food may confer a health benefit. However, these studies do not capture the broader bioactive potential of fermented foods that include more complex mixtures of bacterial strains,�bioactive peptides, microbial metabolites, fibres and other components that can impart beneficial biological effects on the individual (Vieira et al., 2021)."
937,Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health,"Microbial surface molecules and microbial metabolites are implicated in the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier (Spiljar et al., 2017,�Liu et al., 2020b) and the blood brain barrier (Knox et al., 2022a).�SCFA�(Knox et al., 2022b), methylamines (Hoyles et al., 2021),�bile acid�metabolites (Lajczak-Mcginley et al., 2020) and�amino acid�metabolites (Scott et al., 2020,�Stachulski et al., 2022) are some of the metabolites produced by the host�microbiome�that can influence the intestinal and BBB integrity of the host. Fermented foods are a rich source of microorganisms and on consumption can result in production of microbial metabolites that can elicit an immunological response, thereby influencing the integrity of these physiological barriers."
938,Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health,"Several components of fermented foods are being individually studied for their ability to modulate the immune system. The bacterial cellular components of fermented foods have shown the ability to instigate the release of IL-10 from dendritic cells and CD4?+?T cells�(Kim et al., 2019). Other components, such as fermented food�exopolysaccharides�(EPS) are also being explored for their modulatory effects on the immune system, as seen with kefiran, an EPS product produced by�Lactobacillus�kefirofaciens�(Bourrie et al., 2016). Microbial metabolites produced in fermented food also have immunomodulatory abilities. For example,�oleamide, a microbial metabolite produced by�Penicillium�candidum,�is present in products such as�camembert cheese. Oleamide has been shown to suppress TNF-� release from�microglia�by acting as an�agonist�for the P2Y and�cannabinoid receptors�(Kita et al., 2019)."
939,Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis facilitates a constant bidirectional relay of information from the intestine via the�enteric nervous system�(ENS) and from the intestinal milieu consisting of�microbial communities, microbial metabolites, gut associated�lymphoid tissue�(GALT), peripheral immune cells and cytokines to the�brain�and vice versa via the sympathetic/parasympathetic nervous system,�neurotransmitters�and the circulatory�immune system�(Cryan et al., 2019). Fermented foods are rich in microbes and their metabolites. In addition to the�phytochemicals, these metabolites can take the form of neurotransmitters, neuroactives and neuromodulators (Yu et al., 2020), and thereby stimulate the connecting pathways of the microbiota-gut-brain axis: immune, neuroendocrine, enteric nervous and�circulatory system. Upon digestion, they can result in the production of microbial metabolites that can modulate the permeability of the intestinal barrier (Scott et al., 2020) and the�blood brain barrier�(BBB) (Stachulski et al., 2022,�Angelino et al., 2019). Before we discuss the effects of fermented food supplementation on mental health, we outline the current evidence of the ability of fermented foods to modulate the individual components of the microbiota-gut-brain axis so as to exploit them for future microbiota-targeted therapeutics."

941,Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health,"Keeping the brain�active in creation�as referenced by Goethe relies on a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic signals. Over the past two decades, there has been a growing appreciation that the gut microbiota is a key mediator with respect to responding to external signals and triggering intrinsic functions within the body. The microbiota-gut-brain axis consists of a diverse�microbial community�contained in the intestinal environment that is in constant communication with the�central nervous system, and vice versa. The gut microbial community is influenced by a variety of factors ranging from diet (Latorre-P�rez et al., 2021,�Qin et al., 2022,�Asnicar et al., 2021), age (Yatsunenko et al., 2012,�Ghosh et al., 2022), medication use (Ghosh et al., 2022), sex (Cuesta-Zuluaga et al., 2019), ethnicity (Ang et al., 2021,�Dwiyanto et al., 2021) and geographical location (Bai et al., 2022,�Kabwe et al., 2020) and other factors, with diet playing a particularly important role in influencing the microbiota and the metabolites they produce. These microbes and their metabolites influence the hosts intestinal (Del Bo et al., 2021,�Peron et al., 2021), immunological (Longhi et al., 2021,�Wastyk et al., 2021,�Bisgaard et al., 2016,�Li et al., 2016) and neural components (Shi et al., 2021,�Tessier et al., 2021,�Ribeiro et al., 2022) of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. In parallel, meta-analyses examining the relationship between mental health and dietary patterns have hinted at the promise of dietary intervention strategies to influence the cognitive wellbeing of an individual (Abbott et al., 2019,�Ocklenburg and Borawski, 2021,�Taylor et al., 2021). Thus, as a consequence of a combination of these advances, there is a growing interest in targeting the microbiota via diet so as to confer mental health benefits to the host (Berding et al., 2021b). The majority of microbiota-targeted interventions involve�probiotics�(Long-Smith et al., 2020),�prebiotics�(M�rkl et al., 2020), fibres (Berding et al., 2021a), polyphenols (Rodr�guez-Daza et al., 2021), fatty acids (Silva et al., 2020), or, more broadly via changes in habitual dietary consumption (Ghosh et al., 2020,�Millman et al., 2021,�Valls-Pedret et al., 2015). Whole food based dietary interventions are increasingly applied to study mental health (Berding et al., 2021a). These interventions are usually lifelong and are integrated into the habitual diet of the patient. Recently studies have investigated�fermented foods�as a potential avenue of microbiota-targeted intervention strategy (Marx et al., 2020). Although ancient in origin,�fermented foods�are now seen as conduits for introducing beneficial microbes and molecules. Moreover, fermented foods are applicable therapeutics across various socioeconomic sectors given their potential affordability and cross-cultural accessibility."

945,"Editorial: Mental health, epidemiology and machine learning","Finally, ML can also drive the discovery of new insights on the social and environmental influences on mental health, helping to inform policies and practices.�Mason et�al.�first used NLP to extract indicators of violence from routinely collected clinical notes of a mental healthcare provider. They fed these indicators to an ANN to identify actual experiences of violence. They found that violence-related records were more common among women, mid-life adults, ethnic minorities, and those with PTSD or schizophrenia, highlighting the intersection between demographic and clinical factors.�Qasrawi et�al.�showed that children in violent environments exhibit cognitive and mental health patterns that align with general findings on trauma?s developmental impacts.�Castillo-Toledo et�al.�used NLP to study public perceptions of cocaine use on a large sample of social media posts, providing insights into the way some healthcare professionals openly discussed cocaine?s perceived benefits.

946,"Editorial: Mental health, epidemiology and machine learning","ML can also help to personalise mental health services and treatments to better meet patients? individual needs.�Bernard et�al.�applied ML clustering to identify usage patterns among young users of a digital mental health platform, with a battery of sensitivity analyses across clustering methods. Their results, validated through hypothesis testing, indicated that user engagement profiles change over time, highlighting the importance of adaptive digital services tailored to changing user behaviors.�Garriga et�al.�developed an ML model that tailors monitoring duration for psychiatric patients with a depression crisis. For over 20% of patients, their model prescribed monitoring beyond the standard one-week period, suggesting that a ?one-size-fits-all? approach may overlook important individual needs. Additionally,�Yao et�al.�analysed the satisfaction levels of Chinese psychotherapy patients, identifying cultural factors as critical determinants. While the use of ML for personalised psychiatry is not new (6), it is still under-explored. For example, in their systematic review,�Rollmann et�al.�found only four papers investigating ML applications in psychodynamic psychotherapy, but these foundational models suggest that ML could support tailored treatments, predict treatment responses, and match therapists to patients more effectively. The need for additional research is clear, especially as personalised approaches are critical to improving therapeutic outcomes."
947,"Editorial: Mental health, epidemiology and machine learning","Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising tool to address these new challenges, offering the power to work with large-scale data resources and produce new insights. However, ML applications in mental health must be rooted in sound epidemiological practices to ensure clinical relevance and to gain the trust of both healthcare community and the public. Our opinion piece (DelPozo-Banos et�al.) discussed some of these challenges, particularly: (i) the risk of losing sight of mental health objectives in favour of technical performance; (ii) underlying biases and heightened privacy requirements; and (iii) the difficulties of building, validating and approving ML-enabled clinical devices for mental health disorders with insufficiently clear underlying mechanisms. These ideas, and the setting up of the DATAMIND hub provided impetus for the current Research Topic, titled ?Mental Health, Epidemiology, and Machine Learning.? With it, we aimed to highlight ML?s potential role in mental health research and to illustrate clinically and epidemiologically sound ML applications in mental health, making the most of novel data sources and linkages."

949,Noninvasive prediction of perineural invasion in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma by clinicoradiological features and computed tomography radiomics based on interpretable machine learning: a multicenter cohort study,"Our study had several limitations. Firstly, this was a retrospective and prospective study, which may have led to an information selection bias. Secondly, although this was a multicenter study, the relatively low incidence of ICC limited the sample size. Therefore, a larger sample size is required to validate the efficacy of our prediction models in future studies. Thirdly, the manual segmentation of ICC tumours was time-consuming; however, ongoing research in automated segmentation is expected to substantially reduce this workload in the future. Fourthly, the biological interpretability of radiomics remains a significant challenge, and further research is necessary to uncover the underlying connections between radiomics and genomics/proteomics. Finally, despite pathology being considered the gold standard, ICC can sometimes be indistinguishable from perihilar cholangiocarcinoma, potentially introducing bias."
950,Noninvasive prediction of perineural invasion in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma by clinicoradiological features and computed tomography radiomics based on interpretable machine learning: a multicenter cohort study,"We also evaluated preoperative clinical and radiological factors. Our results showed that PLR, tumour location, and arterial phase enhancement were independent variables associated with the PNI. PLR and NLR are commonly used peripheral blood inflammatory markers. These inflammatory factors can stimulate tumour blood vessels formation, leading to a higher invasiveness of the tumour and being associated with poor prognosis31,32. We speculate that PNI-positive ICC exhibits greater invasiveness, leading to a more pronounced peripheral inflammatory response. Our results recapitulate previous findings that the perihilar ICC is closely correlated with the PNI33; poor histological differentiation of perihilar ICC, which is more invasive, or the rich distribution of the nerve plexus around the hepatic portal may explain this34. Diffuse arterial hypoenhancement is another important PNI predictor. According to previous studies, tumours contain abundant fibrous stroma, leading to low enhancement in the arterial phase, which is associated with more aggressive biological behaviour and a poor prognosis35,36, and may provide a bridge for tumour cell progression and migration, making it more likely to invade blood vessels and nerves."

The incidence rate of PNI in the three institutions in our study was also unbalanced (38.3%, 54.8%, and 45.8%, respectively), and we merged institutions I and II to ensure the consistency of their PNI incidence rate with the institution III (43.4%, 45.8%). Second, the CT scanning models and parameters at each institution differed. In addition, data heterogeneity was reduced throughvoxel resampling and grey-level discretization pre-processing.

To reduce noise and discretize intensities, the Hounsfield units were set to 25 bins15?17. A radiologist with five years of abdominal diagnosis experience (Reader 3) segmented the tumour using three-dimensional Slicer (version 4.10.2;�http://www.slicer.org). The tumour volume of interest (VOI�tumour) was manually drawn on each transverse section from the arterial and portal venous phases. In reference to previous peritumoral radiomics studies18,19, the peritumoral VOI (VOI�10�mm) was defined as 10�mm. The entire VOI (VOI�tumour+10�mm) included the tumour and the peritumoral VOIs. The segmentation results were validated by a senior radiologist with ten years of abdominal diagnosis experience (Reader 4) who randomly selected 30 samples from a cohort. The reproducibility of the extracted features was evaluated by the inter-class correlation coefficient. Finally, the VOI�tumour, VOI10�mm, and VOI�tumour+10�mm�were saved for subsequent quantitative feature extraction."

963,Noninvasive prediction of perineural invasion in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma by clinicoradiological features and computed tomography radiomics based on interpretable machine learning: a multicenter cohort study,"Perineural invasion (PNI) is characterized by the infiltration of tumour cells along the nerves and/or within the neuronal sheath?s epineural, perineural, and endoneurial regions, encompassing at least one-third of the nerves circumference4. As a potential route of tumour spread, it has been proposed as a strong independent risk factor for tumour recurrence and long-term survival in ICC5,6, and the ICC patients with PNI may benefit from a wide resection margin7,8.

968,The Impact of Social Media Use on Sleep and Mental Health in Youth: a Scoping Review,"There are several potential avenues for future investigation. Firstly, prospective cohort studies using representative samples are needed to elucidate the magnitude and directionality of relationships among SMU, sleep, and mental health, which is of clinical practice implication for precision intervention. To capture the varying dynamics among SMU, sleep, and mental health across different age groups of adolescents (early and late adolescents), it is recommended that prospective studies may need to have a follow-up period that will better cover the entirety of adolescence period [41]. Secondly, the lack of consistency in the methodologies employed by different studies measuring SMU has been a major contributing factor to the conflicting findings found in the current literature. It is imperative to use validated questionnaires to measure the SMU. More importantly, objective measurements (e.g., screen time monitors on smartphones [87], ecological momentary assessments [88], and wearable devices [89]) should also be incorporated. Apart from timing, it is equally important to capture the content, and number of devices that subjects engage with. Thirdly, future research should consider conducting randomized controlled trials at different levels (e.g., individual, school, and family) to reduce overall and problematic SMU and to ultimately improve sleep and mental health outcomes in youth. The design of the intervention may benchmark to existing guidelines such as the American Academy of Paediatrics recommendations 2016 on media use [90], and the WHO guidelines on physical activity and sedentary behavior [91], in which both guidelines recommend limiting the amount of recreational screen time, and avoiding SMU 1�h before bedtime. Intervention formats may consider psychoeducation, cognitive and behavioral techniques, and motivational interviewing. Finally, priority may be given to conduct observational and interventional studies on SMU in vulnerable populations, such as youth experiencing mood or sleep problems, as well as those who are high-risk offspring of parents with sleep and mood disorders, as these populations are more susceptible to experience significant negative impacts from inappropriate and excessive SMU [92]."
969,The Impact of Social Media Use on Sleep and Mental Health in Youth: a Scoping Review,"In addition to these behavioral and cognitive factors, cyberbullying is also one of the important mediators of SMU and mental health in youth [81]. Cyberbullying has become a prevalent phenomenon worldwide, with victimization rates in children and adolescents ranging from 14 to 57.5%, and lifetime perpetration rates ranging from 6.0 to 46.3% [82,�83]. Previous meta-analytical study demonstrated that cyberbullying significantly increased the risks of developing depression, self-harm, suicidal attempts, and ideation [84]. Moreover, over the COVID-19 pandemic, stressors associated with disasters have also been reported to potentially exacerbate the negative effects of SMU on mental health, thereby increasing the risk for mental health issues [85,�86]."
970,The Impact of Social Media Use on Sleep and Mental Health in Youth: a Scoping Review,"Numerous mechanisms have been proposed to elucidate the relationship between social/digital media usage and sleep quantity and quality [66]. Hyperarousal, a core mechanism in explaining insomnia [67], plays a role in explaining how night-time SMU disrupts sleep. Active engagement in media activities can directly induce physiological and psychological arousal, leading to longer sleep onset latency [68]. This effect is particularly noticeable when individuals actively engage in interactive digital media, such as social messaging and social media, as opposed to passive media consumption like television viewing [69?], likely due to the heightened arousal associated with interactive activities [70]. Interestingly, a study found that engaging in phone conversations near bedtime was associated with longer sleep duration, while the use of social media and texting displayed a negative association [71]. It has been hypothesized that conversing with a friend may positively influence emotional well-being, thereby promoting sleep [72]. However, social networking, despite its potential for fostering friendships, may also trigger FOMO and social media stress. In addition to the psychological arousal induced by electronic media usage, the light emitted from device screens is another hypothesis explaining the detrimental effects of digital media on sleep. Specifically, the light emitted by electronic devices, especially blue light (at a wavelength of 480�nm), has a significant impact on the suppression of melatonin, a hormone that promotes sleep [73]. Moreover, a recent study indicated that high-risk adolescents whose parents with bipolar affective disorder have lower level of nocturnal melatonin secretion. It might be possible that adolescents with certain risk factors (even without psychopathologies) may be particularly hypersensitive and vulnerable to light suppression of melatonin secretion [74], which are considered as high-risk group that require early intervention. Furthermore, it is plausible that an interaction or interplay might exist between arousal and light exposure, and the combination of these conditions could potentially heighten the risk of sleep disturbances. Additionally, the direct displacement of sleep resulting from engagement in social media activities may also lead to shorter sleep duration. Although initial evidence suggests a negative impact of both content and light emitted by electronic devices on sleep, the precise underlying mechanism remains poorly established. Last but not least, some preliminary studies have also investigated other sleep- and circadian-related factors such as chronotype preference and daytime sleepiness in mediating and/or moderating the relationship between SMU and sleep [32?,�44,�54], albeit the findings have been inconclusive. Future studies are warranted to thoroughly explore the role of these factors in the interplay between SMU and sleep."
971,The Impact of Social Media Use on Sleep and Mental Health in Youth: a Scoping Review,"Nevertheless, it is essential to highlight that recent research has also recognized the positive impacts of SMU on mental health, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, at which physical social interactions were significantly disrupted [56?,�58]. Adolescents in Australia and UK were found to use social media as an active coping strategy to relieve external stressors (e.g., exam pressure), to seek support for suicidal ideation or self-harm behavior, and to support others via social media [56?,�58]."
972,The Impact of Social Media Use on Sleep and Mental Health in Youth: a Scoping Review,"Four longitudinal cohort studies reported mixed findings between SMU and mental health [41,�63,�64?,�65]. Two cohort studies conducted in the USA and China reported that frequent and problematic SMU were significantly associated subsequent mental health issues [64?,�65]. Interestingly, the authors identified substantial sex differences in the mental health trajectories, with only girls showing a deteriorating linear trend (??=?0.23,�p?<?0.05) [64?]. On the contrary, the other two longitudinal studies conducted in Sweden and UK reported that although frequent SMU was associated with increased levels of mental problems at a single timepoint, there was no longitudinal association [41,�63], which suggests that SMU may be only an indicator for mental health instead of a risk factor."
973,The Impact of Social Media Use on Sleep and Mental Health in Youth: a Scoping Review,"Among the three cohort studies, two indicated that higher levels of SMU predicted later bedtime and shorter sleep duration in youth after 1?2�years of follow-up [37,�54]. These studies revealed that both frequent and problematic use of SMU could result in later bedtime [37,�54]. In addition, Richardson and colleagues further found that SMU predicted greater daytime sleepiness in adolescence [54]. In addition, adolescents with evening chronotype preference and shorter sleep duration were found to have longer usage of social media, suggesting a potential bidirectional relationship between SMU and sleep duration [54]. Another cohort study conducted by Maksniemi and colleagues did not find a significant association between SMU and bedtime among 426 youth aged between 13 and 19 [25?]. Interestingly, subgroup analyses indicated that significant associations were only observed in early adolescence (at age 13 and 14), but not in middle (at age 14 and 15) nor late adolescence (at age 17 and 18) [25?]. This finding highlights the importance of considering the developmental stages of youth in order to unravel the complex relationship between SMU and sleep [55]."
974,The Impact of Social Media Use on Sleep and Mental Health in Youth: a Scoping Review,"In terms of sleep outcome assessment, most of these studies employed subjective instruments such as sleep diary [32?], self-developed self-report questionnaires (e.g., ?How many hours did you sleep over the past week??) [43], and validated self-report questionnaires (e.g., the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Insomnia Severity Index) [44,�45?] to measure different sleep outcomes including sleep quality, sleep duration, sleep displacement, bedtime, and sleep-onset latency. In addition to these subjective instruments, 3 studies have utilized objective devices such as actigraphy and other wearable devices to capture objective sleep data [43,�46,�47]. While for mental health aspects, depression and anxiety are the main outcomes. Most of the recent studies utilized standardized questionnaires such as the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales 21, and the Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised to measure the symptoms of depression and anxiety."
975,The Impact of Social Media Use on Sleep and Mental Health in Youth: a Scoping Review,"A total of 33 studies were included in this scoping review, with 26 of them were cross-sectional in nature, indicating a snapshot overview of the relationship between SMU, sleep, and mental health. Moreover, only a few studies utilized representative samples [35,�36,�40,�41], as outlined in Table�1. It is also worth noting that the sample sizes varied significantly across studies, ranging from 54 to 195,668 participants."
976,The Impact of Social Media Use on Sleep and Mental Health in Youth: a Scoping Review,"Over the past decade, subjective measures have been the primary tool to investigate individual perceptions, opinions, or personal experiences of SMU. For example, a self-report scale was developed to assess compulsive use of social media and its severity [31]. Besides, there are several platform-specific scales for social media addiction features such as salience, mood modification, tolerance, withdrawal, conflict, and relapse. The Bergen Facebook Addiction Scale, for instance, focuses specifically on addiction to Facebook [32?], while the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale has emerged to examine a broader scope, including social media platforms beyond Facebook [33?,�34]. Indeed, more researchers used general metrics to measure SMU across multiple platforms collectively such as the Social Media Disorder Scale which measures aspects of social media addiction features, such as preoccupation with social media, excessive time spent, withdrawal symptoms, and negative consequences [35?37]. Other SMU experiences are also captured including social comparison on social media and negative experiences such as bullying, FOMO, and extensive negative feedback [32?]."
977,The Impact of Social Media Use on Sleep and Mental Health in Youth: a Scoping Review,"This scoping review summarized recent studies on SMU, sleep, and mental health in youth (Fig.�1) and explored the potential underlying mechanisms of how SMU affects sleep and mental health in youth (Fig.�2). Finally, we have put forward several potential avenues for future research and recommendations in this area. Search terms including #adolescent, #social media, #sleep, and #mental health were used to search for relevant studies that were published between January 2020 and July 2023 in MEDLINE. A summary of the study attributes, such as the authors, the country/region where the study was conducted, study design, the number of participants, sample age range, characteristics, as well as the measures used to assess SMU, sleep, and mental health are listed in Table�1."
978,The Impact of Social Media Use on Sleep and Mental Health in Youth: a Scoping Review,"There are multiple risk factors that commonly contribute to sleep and mental health problems, including being female, heavy school workload, physical inactivity, and worse general health [9]. Recently, a growing number of studies indicate that social media use (SMU) is associated with both sleep and mental health problems in youth [10?]. In particular, identity development and peer acceptance during adolescence are important developmental needs, at which social media may apparently serve as a convenient means to meet these needs. A previous study reported that over 80% of adolescents (16?19�years) use electronic devices near bedtime [11]. On the other hand, excessive SMU can have detrimental health effects [12,�13], and contribute to various negative repercussions such as cyberbullying [14], gender stereotypes [15], self-objectification [16], and exposure to inappropriate content, such as unsolicited violent and sexual contents [17]. The effect becomes more prominent in young people who are considered as digital native [18]. Nevertheless, SMU also comes with some potential benefits [19] such as increased self-esteem [20], increased social capital [21], identity presentation and sexual exploration [22], and social support [23]."
979,The Impact of Social Media Use on Sleep and Mental Health in Youth: a Scoping Review,"Recent studies have made advances with a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of SMU on sleep and mental health in youth, which is of public health importance and will contribute to improving sleep and mental health outcomes while promoting rational and beneficial SMU. Future research should include the implementation of cohort studies with representative samples to investigate the directionality and causality of the complex relationships among SMU, sleep, and mental health; the use of validated questionnaires and objective measurements; and the design of randomized controlled interventional trials to reduce overall and problematic SMU that will ultimately enhance sleep and mental health outcomes in youth."
980,The Impact of Social Media Use on Sleep and Mental Health in Youth: a Scoping Review,"Social media use (SMU) and other internet-based technologies are ubiquitous in today?s interconnected society, with young people being among the commonest users. Previous literature tends to support that SMU is associated with poor sleep and mental health issues in youth, despite some conflicting findings. In this scoping review, we summarized relevant studies published within the past 3�years, highlighted the impacts of SMU on sleep and mental health in youth, while also examined the possible underlying mechanisms involved. Future direction and intervention on rational use of SMU was discussed."
981,The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Finally, most DMHL interventions (56/76, 74%) were found in Western cultural contexts, especially in high-income countries (Global North), and most studies on DMHL interventions (36/76, 47%) did not report information on the racial or ethnic composition of their samples. Among those that did, the samples were predominantly White with limited racial or ethnic diversity. As such, our findings may not be generalizable to other geographic regions or demographic groups. In light of contextual stressors associated with racial and ethnic marginalization and mental health disparities, future work on DMHL interventions that target racial or ethnic minority groups, particularly the design, adoption, and evaluation of the effects of culturally adaptive DMHL interventions on uptake and mental health functioning, is needed [42-44]. Collectively, our review and meta-analysis of DMHL and mental health makes important theoretical and practical contributions. For theory building on DMHL, we found evidence for the fundamental effectiveness of DMHL interventions that increased postintervention mental health and strong inferences for DMHL interventions? effectiveness in bolstering mental health as compared with waitlist control conditions. However, DMHL interventions confer optimal effects on mental health when DMHL psychoeducation is incorporated with informal, nonprofessional active treatment components such as skills training and peer support, which demonstrates comparable effectiveness with that of treatment as usual involving client-professional interactions and therapies. However, none of the interventions in this review considered the mechanism of action regarding how DMHL affects proximal outcomes that in turn affect distal mental health conditions. The large effect size of DMHL interventions on MHL outcomes indicates that literacy may serve as a mediating mechanism for enhancing mental health functioning. Thus, the MHL framework needs to unpack and incorporate different components of DMHL, especially in how they relate to the 5 DMHL facets, and consider their interplay with various active treatment components. More importantly, proximal and distal factors involved in the mechanism of action of DMHL and mental health need to be examined to build and expand the MHL framework."
982,The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Second, DMHL interventions are not always clear about the facet of DMHL examined and rarely refer to the theoretical framework of DMHL that distinguishes five literacy facets [5,6]: (1) knowledge about obtaining and maintaining good mental health, (2) understanding mental illnesses and treatments, (3) reducing mental illness?related stigma, (4) enhancing help-seeking efficacy or behaviors, and (5) enhancing help-seeking attitudes or intentions. We recommend that future research recognize the conceptualization of DMHL facets and be clear about the facet of DMHL that demonstrates a positive relationship to or efficacy in enhancing mental health. Such an approach would facilitate a comprehensive and converged understanding of the conditions under which DMHL most strongly relates to and effectively increases mental health functioning. On a similar note, DMHL interventions do not always include both proximal literacy outcomes and distal mental health outcomes, which are important in establishing mechanisms of change with proximal literacy outcomes as possible mediators. As the field of DMHL interventions is nascent [8,9], studies have primarily focused on examining mental health outcomes (clinical outcomes) [8,9], and a major gap remains in understanding implementation effectiveness involving uptake and engagement. Drawing from work on digital mental health interventions, user uptake and engagement can vary across different indicators and affect intervening effectiveness on mental health outcomes [8,26]. Extant research on digital mental health interventions, including DMHL, largely focuses on attrition as an indicator of uptake and engagement. Future DMHL interventions should consider other engagement indicators to demonstrate the extent of intervention use and potential key features for effectiveness."
983,The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"In general, there is lower MHL, greater mental health stigma, and fewer services provided in the Global South [42-44]. DMHL interventions may be an important and accessible mental health resource that could not only provide greater access and reach and reduce stigma but also improve MHL among the public [42-44]. Our review found that DMHL interventions are implemented and evaluated mainly in Western cultural contexts in high-income countries [42-44] and some contemporary Asian societies [99,100]. Our results call for greater research attention to the design, implementation, and evaluation of culturally appropriate DMHL interventions in Asian, South American, and African countries, as well as more diversity in research in the Global North. Contextual stressors associated with racial and ethnic marginalization and mental health disparities, including lower access to and greater barriers to engaging in digital mental health interventions, underscore the need for future work on DMHL interventions specifically and digital mental health interventions broadly that target racial or ethnic minority groups [42-44]."
984,The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"In contrast to our hypothesis, the impact of DMHL interventions did not differ between Western and Eastern cultural contexts. Most Asian societies with collectivistic cultural characteristics are conservative in the way in which they address mental health concerns and often promote MHL and positive mental health functioning in ways that differ from those of Western cultural contexts with individualistic cultural characteristics. For instance, cultivating interdependence relations, relational harmony, and dialectical beliefs and emotions may be more common in Eastern cultures [68]. Furthermore, the Asian community as a whole, including policy makers, mental health professionals, and the public, is only beginning to embrace the notion of digital mental health interventions [99,100]. On the other hand, studies on digital mental health interventions, especially DMHL interventions, are conducted predominantly in Western cultural contexts in high-income countries (Global North) [8,9], where there is greater public awareness of and less stigma associated with mental health conditions and greater focus on developing a healthy sense of independent self, including positive mental health [67,68]."
985,The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Unexpectedly, our synthesis did not find dosage effect. Although other studies have found the median dosage or duration of interventions to be approximately 10 weeks [60], our meta-regressions indicated that DMHL interventions with a dosage of 10 weeks had similar impacts on enhancing mental health as dosages below and above 10 weeks. Our amalgamated findings suggest that the 10-week dosage that is commonly adopted by digital mental health interventions may not be optimal for DMHL interventions [61,62]. More research involving RCTs on digital mental health and DMHL interventions alike that examine the effects of varying dosages of interventions on mental health outcomes is warranted. However, our findings are promising given the challenges with mental health services and MHL intervention retention found in many countries [97,98]. Collectively, our meta-analysis and meta-regressions on the moderating role of DMHL intervention features provide important insights into best practices in DMHL that enhance mental health. Consistent with global efforts to raise mental health awareness and improve poor MHL in the public [1], this synthesis advances our understanding of DMHL by building a conceptual model of MHL [4] that could inform the design and implementation of evidence-based DMHL interventions [8]."
986,The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"The long-term effects of DMHL interventions on mental health, which averaged 18.2 (SD 3.49; range 4-34) weeks in this synthesis, suggest that the 5 facets of DMHL may be involved in a chain reaction or cascade effect on mental health [94]. Details as to which facets could not be obtained because of a dearth of research that examined all 5 facets of DMHL and mental well-being conjointly and separately. Thus, there are insufficient studies (and number of effect sizes) to determine how the 5 facets of DMHL compare regarding their impacts on mental health. By building knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes regarding mental health, DMHL interventions may have adaptive functions that influence other domains or levels of function (eg, behavior change in treatment uptake and adherence) that spread over time to promote positive mental health development [94]. Future research should unravel the role of the 5 facets of DMHL in well-timed and targeted interventions that promote positive mental health cascades."
987,The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Our synthesis of findings across studies on the overall effectiveness of DMHL interventions on mental health, combined with current work demonstrating the ease of access and cost-efficiency of DMHL interventions [27,28], supports the adoption and implementation of DMHL interventions at scale. Such efforts are beneficial at the simple level of self-help DMHL psychoeducation but are even more impactful when coupled with other active treatments. Interventions that combined DMHL with other treatments had the same mental health impact as treatment as usual and professional therapies. Such findings underscore the importance of rigorous intervention designs that examine different components. In particular, using randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to compare and distinguish the impacts of DMHL in combination with different active treatment components such as skills training; peer support; group discussions and activities; exercises such as diary entries and reflection logs; informal, nonprofessional counselor interactions; and care as usual in changing mental health functioning is pivotal. Such a nuanced approach can ascertain how DMHL should be supplemented with active treatment as a necessary and sufficient intervening factor and to establish the relationship to proximal literacy outcomes and distal mental health functioning as mechanisms of change [91]."
988,The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Our meta-analytic efforts to synthesize and compare findings on interventions with different DMHL components revealed aspects of DMHL interventions that were the most promising or effective in bolstering mental health functioning. In particular,�DMHL plus, which incorporated DMHL as a secondary component with other active treatment components such as skills training; peer support; group discussions and activities; exercises such as diary entries and reflection logs; and informal, nonprofessional counselor interactions [15,21], was the most effective. DMHL plus interventions were superior to waitlist control [15,50] and�DMHL only�conditions [21,51] and comparable with non-DMHL interventions in enhancing mental health functioning [28,52]. Such findings are not surprising given that�DMHL plus�includes some form of active treatment. However, basic forms of DMHL intervention that involve self-help DMHL psychoeducation that builds MHL can be more effective in bolstering mental health than the absence of such interventions [20,21]. This notion was supported by our findings?DMHL only�interventions that involved self-help DMHL psychoeducation were more effective than waitlist control conditions in enhancing mental health functioning, with large effect sizes. Beyond fundamental effectiveness, in which mental health increases after as compared with before the intervention, DMHL interventions effectively enhanced mental health as compared with waitlist control conditions [21,51]. DMHL interventions had similar effectiveness to that of non-DMHL interventions such as treatment or care as usual that involved professional therapies [28,52]."
989,The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"We found that DMHL interventions had a similar impact on mental health to that of traditional face-to-face MHL interventions. Engagement with DMHL interventions, which was assessed as the percentage of users who completed the intervention, ranged from 13.1% to 100% (dropout of 0% to 86.9%). However, participation in DMHL interventions did not differ from that in the control conditions, and uptake of DMHL interventions did not moderate their impact on proximal (DMHL) or distal (mental health) outcomes. Studies of the facilitators of and barriers to the uptake of digital mental health interventions argue that engagement affects intervening effectiveness on mental health outcomes [8,26]. Our review and meta-analysis found limited work on the implementation effectiveness of DMHL interventions involving engagement and uptake that was focused primarily on attrition, indicating a need for future studies to consider other engagement indicators that demonstrate participation in interventions [8,26]. For instance, studies could consider the extent of content accessed (eg, number of modules completed) or engagement in intervention-related activities (eg, number of log-ins or visits, time spent, specific activities or exercises completed, and number of web-based interactions with therapists or peers) [8,26]."
990,The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Second, our comparison of different DMHL intervention components and conditions, which included�DMHL only�(self-help DMHL psychoeducation) versus waitlist control conditions,�DMHL plus�(DMHL psychoeducation incorporated as a secondary component in other active treatments) versus waitlist control conditions,�DMHL only�versus�DMHL plus, and�DMHL plus�versus non-DMHL (treatment as usual involving client-professional interactions and therapies such as CBT and dialectical therapy), found differential impacts on mental health outcomes. Compared with waitlist control conditions,�DMHL only�(SMD=0.59) and�DMHL plus�(SMD=0.45;�P=.02) had similar positive mental health impacts. The effect size of�DMHL only�versus waitlist control was significantly greater than that of�DMHL only�versus�DMHL plus�(SMD=?0.35;�P=.02), which indicates that the effectiveness of�DMHL only�interventions on mental health was significantly lower than that of�DMHL plus�interventions. On the other hand, the effect size of�DMHL plus�versus waitlist control was similar to that of�DMHL only�versus�DMHL plus�and�DMHL plus�versus non-DMHL (SMD=?0.33;�P=.02). In other words, compared with waitlist control conditions,�DMHL only, and non-DMHL,�DMHL plus�had similar positive effects on mental health."
991,The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"The rise in mental health issues worldwide accelerated during the pandemic, highlighting the need for upstream mental health prevention [1]. A key approach to mental health prevention is to build individuals? resiliency, which can protect them from and mediate the negative impacts of adversity and risk factors for the development of psychopathology [54]. Recent work on digital mental health interventions, particularly with DMHL, provides evidence for DMHL as a resilience factor that might mitigate stress and mental health conditions among working adults and students [36,37]. DMHL interventions combine ease of access with low cost, which has the potential to reduce public burden on a global scale by intervening in the mental health of individuals [27,28]. Overcoming the shortcomings of traditional face-to-face MHL interventions?specifically, low availability, high threshold for participation, and substantial delivery costs [27,28]?DMHL interventions may be more effective in addressing low levels of MHL in the public [2], which is an impediment to the uptake of, engagement in, and adherence to mental health prevention and intervention [2]. However, research on the effectiveness of DMHL interventions is scattered, and findings on their impact on mental health outcomes are inconclusive. This systematic review and meta-analysis is the first to provide empirical findings on the mental health implications of DMHL interventions."
992,The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Developmental stages, including adolescence, emerging adulthood, and adulthood; sex, which was measured as the average proportion of participants in the sample who were female; and severity of mental health conditions at baseline were used as continuous predictors in testing their moderating effects. Contrary to hypothesis 4a, sex (Qbetween=2.01;�P=.34) did not moderate the impact of DMHL interventions on mental health. Contrary to our hypothesis, DMHL interventions were more effective in enhancing the mental health of emerging and older adults than that of adolescents (hypothesis 4b;�Qbetween=12.19;�P=.001), and the severity of mental health conditions did not attenuate the effect of DMHL interventions on mental health (hypothesis 4c;�Qbetween=0.29;�P=.45; Table S1 in�Multimedia Appendix 6)."
993,The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"For RQ 2a, we compared DMHL interventions with DMHL alone or with additional aspects (ie,�DMHL only�vs waitlist control conditions,�DMHL plus�vs waitlist control conditions,�DMHL only�vs�DMHL plus, and�DMHL plus�vs non-DMHL).�Q�statistics analyses comparing these 4 conditions indicated that they differed significantly (Qbetween=9.45;�P=.01). The effect size of�DMHL only�versus waitlist control was comparable with that of�DMHL plus�versus waitlist control but greater than that of�DMHL only�versus�DMHL plus�and�DMHL plus�versus non-DMHL (Table S1 in�Multimedia Appendix 3). To address RQ 2b, we synthesized the effect sizes from 44.4% (64/144) of the DMHL interventions to elucidate whether we could draw stronger inferences about the effectiveness of DMHL interventions in increasing mental health.�Q�statistics analyses comparing the effect sizes of pretest-posttest DMHL intervention comparisons, waitlist control conditions versus DMHL interventions, and DMHL versus non-DMHL interventions revealed that they differed significantly (Qbetween=12.09;�P<.001), with higher effect sizes for pretest-posttest DMHL intervention comparisons and waitlist control conditions versus DMHL interventions than for DMHL versus non-DMHL interventions. For RQ 3, subgroup comparison of DMHL interventions that assessed mental health outcomes at the postintervention time point and those with follow-up assessments indicated that they did not differ significantly (Qbetween=3.81;�P=.06), with the effect sizes for interventions that assessed postintervention effects on mental health and those that assessed follow-up effects being comparable. Consistently, the carryover effects of DMHL interventions on mental health did not attenuate over time (Qbetween=1.65;�P=.20; Table S1 in�Multimedia Appendix 3); the positive effects of DMHL interventions on mental health remained notwithstanding longer follow-up assessments."

996,The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Studies included in the meta-analysis were independently evaluated for quality by 2 reviewers, with differences discussed and resolved. DMHL interventions were assessed using the instrument by Downs and Black [85] and the Cochrane Collaboration risk-of-bias tool [86]. We report these results in�Multimedia Appendix 2."
997,The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"A total of 146 studies with 208 effect sizes were included in our meta-analyses, with 2 (1.4%) field studies reporting relevant correlation coefficients and 144 (98.6%) intervention studies providing sufficient statistics to compute the standardized mean difference (SMD; Cohen�d), which contributed 2 and 206 effect sizes, respectively. Although DMHL interventions are examined in field studies and as interventions in experimental studies, it is methodologically feasible to examine both field and experimental studies within the same meta-analysis [75,76]. However, we excluded the field studies (2/146, 1.4%) as they contributed only 2 effect size estimates, which are insufficient for a comparison of the relationship between DMHL and mental health across field and intervention studies."

Do DMHL interventions demonstrate a stronger inference on intervening in mental health functioning?

1005,The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,1. What is the effect of DMHL interventions on uptake as an implementation outcome? (RQ 1a)
1006,The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"To our knowledge, no systematic review or meta-analysis has evaluated the effectiveness of DMHL interventions on mental well-being or the moderating factors between these 2. To this end, our efforts to synthesize findings across studies focused on the main mental health impacts of DMHL interventions. First, we ascertained how DMHL interventions compare with traditional face-to-face MHL interventions in affecting mental health outcomes. Second, we examined the effects of DMHL interventions on the implementation outcome of uptake and the proximal DMHL outcomes and distal mental health outcomes. In addition, we examined whether uptake of DMHL interventions affects the impact on the proximal DMHL outcomes and distal mental health outcomes. Third, we investigated the impact of DMHL interventions on mental health through the following DMHL components: (1)�DMHL only�(self-help DMHL psychoeducation that entails acquiring knowledge and information), (2)�DMHL plus�(DMHL psychoeducation combined with skills training; peer support; group discussions and activities; exercises such as diary entries and reflection logs; and informal, nonprofessional counselor interactions), (3)�DMHL only�versus non-DMHL (treatment as usual through professional therapies such as CBT and dialectical therapy), and (4)�DMHL plus�versus non-DMHL. Fourth, our review and meta-analytic efforts provide evidence for a stronger inference on the effectiveness of DMHL interventions on mental health functioning by combining and comparing results across three study designs: (1) pre- and postintervention comparison, (2) intervention group versus (waitlist) control group, and (3) DMHL intervention versus non-DMHL intervention. Fifth, we addressed the gap in the current literature regarding the long-lasting effectiveness of DMHL interventions on mental health by assessing carryover effects. Finally, we considered potential moderators of treatment effects, including dosage, platform, individual characteristics, and culture."
1007,The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Drawing from meta-analyses and systematic reviews of digital mental health interventions, individual factors related to preexisting physical and mental health conditions can modulate the effectiveness of interventions [8]. Physical illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis can interact and generate or exacerbate mental health problems and reduce the effectiveness of interventions [63]. The severity of one?s preexisting mental illness can limit intra- and interpersonal resources (ie, motivation and supportive relationships, respectively) for uptake of, engagement in, and adherence to digital mental health interventions, thus reducing their effectiveness [8]. Extending these arguments to DMHL interventions, some research has shown that individual factors, particularly being female and having a mental health problem, are associated with relatively high levels of MHL and reduced effects of DMHL interventions on mental health outcomes (a possible ceiling effect [64]). However, these moderating effects of sex and preexisting mental health conditions on the intervening effectiveness of DMHL interventions are tentative and not consistently documented across studies [64,65]. Thus, the characteristics of individuals need to be considered as important moderators."
1008,The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Furthermore, DMHL interventions are inconsistent in whether they assess proximal outcomes only [17,18], distal outcomes only [19,54], or a combination of both increased literacy outcomes and better mental health conditions [21,28]. DMHL research often fails to acknowledge how changes in proximal DMHL outcomes factor in the effects of DMHL interventions on distal outcomes?mental health functioning [49,54]. Thus, research that distinguishes the effectiveness of DMHL interventions on both proximal DMHL outcomes and distal mental health outcomes is warranted. In addition, studies have obtained inconsistent findings on the effectiveness of DMHL interventions on the same mental health outcomes, such as depression [49,54], as well as across different mental health outcomes [58,59]. On the basis of the body of work on traditional face-to-face MHL interventions, researchers have argued for the importance of examining MHL with specific mental health outcomes (eg, eating disorders and depression) [2]. However, research on DMHL is in its infancy, and the existing literature contains insufficient estimates to test the impact of DMHL interventions on the range of mental health outcomes."
1009,The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Findings on the effectiveness of DMHL interventions on mental health outcomes are mixed, with some studies demonstrating positive effects [39,49] and others finding none [28,53]. A possible reason for these inconsistent findings is the contradictory ways of conceptualizing and operationalizing DMHL and mental health outcomes in DMHL interventions. Although most interventions include a DMHL component, few draw on the long-standing MHL paradigm [16,55]. Hence, for most interventions, it is often ambiguous which of the five facets of MHL were examined, including one or some combination of them [15,56]: (1) knowledge about obtaining and maintaining good mental health, (2) understanding mental illnesses and treatments, (3) reducing mental illness?related stigma, (4) enhancing help-seeking efficacy or behaviors, and (5) enhancing help-seeking attitudes or intentions [4]."
1010,The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Drawing from reviews and meta-analyses on digital mental health interventions (in the absence of similar work on DMHL), findings indicate that most interventions are implemented and evaluated in high-income countries (Global North) involving White samples [42-44]. Given existing mental health disparities that are compounded with the mental health costs of marginalization, racial and ethnic minority groups face greater mental health risks, including limited access to and greater barriers to engaging in digital treatment interventions for mental health [42-44]. Such findings underscore the need to attend to the ethnic or racial composition of the samples to understand the overall effectiveness of digital mental health interventions, including DMHL, on uptake and mental health outcomes. In considering impact, scholars and practitioners have called for attention to the long-term mental health implications of DMHL?specifically, the carryover effects of DMHL interventions on mental health functioning [36,45]. For instance, some DMHL interventions demonstrate no carryover effects [46,47], whereas others yield 3, 6, or 12 weeks of carryover effects [48,49]. Such evidence can drive the adoption and implementation of evidence-based DMHL interventions at scale, which represents a key foundation for practice-changing impacts in the provision of mental health resources for individuals and the community."
1011,The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"However, there is no conclusive evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of DMHL interventions compared with traditional face-to-face MHL interventions in bolstering mental health [40,41]. To establish evidence-based practices for DMHL interventions, an integrated and comprehensive investigation of DMHL features and affordances, as well as individual and contextual factors that amplify or attenuate the effectiveness of DMHL interventions on mental health, is needed [8,9]. The primary aim of our systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness of DMHL interventions on mental health by targeting several objectives. First, we addressed the lacunae in our current understanding of DMHL interventions by synthesizing findings across studies to ascertain how DMHL interventions compare with traditional face-to-face MHL interventions. Next, we assessed whether and how different DMHL components in DMHL interventions affect mental health outcomes. Third, we investigated the effectiveness of DMHL interventions on proximal MHL outcomes (eg, knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs) and distal mental health outcomes. Fourth, we established whether a strong inference can be drawn about the effectiveness of DMHL interventions?whether they are fundamentally effective (ie, pretest-posttest DMHL intervention comparisons) and more effective than well-controlled conditions. Finally, we amalgamated findings across studies to establish the long-term implications (carryover effects) of DMHL interventions for mental health functioning. A secondary aim was to identify moderating factors that amplify or attenuate the effectiveness of DMHL interventions, particularly DMHL features and affordances (new vs conventional platforms and dosages of intervention) and individual (sex, developmental differences, and severity of preexisting mental health conditions) and contextual (cultural contexts) factors."
1012,The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"DMHL interventions may also help populations that are not reached by existing traditional MHL approaches, particularly young people, whose lives are closely intertwined with digital media and are the primary users of web-based mental health resources [30]. DMHL interventions address 2 critical issues that traditional face-to-face MHL interventions encounter in targeting mental health, especially for youth mental health?concern for anonymity and limited reach [31]. For young people, the increased prevalence of mental health conditions, especially depression and anxiety [32,33], underscores the need to address major barriers to help-seeking behaviors, for instance, access, reach, and stigma [34]. Thus, DMHL interventions may play a particularly important role during adolescence and emerging adulthood as a cost-effective channel to intervene early in preventing mental illness and supporting mental health functioning [35]."
1013,The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Importantly, interventions with different DMHL components can have differential impacts on proximal and distal mental health outcomes [24,25]. DMHL interventions with DMHL psychoeducation can increase knowledge and beliefs about recognition, management, or prevention of mental disorders (the 5 facets of DMHL described previously) and likely have a greater impact on proximal (eg, knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs) than on distal (eg, improved mental health) [16] mental health outcomes. DMHL interventions coupled with active treatment components, on the other hand, may enhance both proximal and distal mental health outcomes [15]. Meta-analyses have focused on digital mental health treatment interventions such as professional therapies and skill-based training (eg, CBT and mindfulness meditation, respectively) [26]. There are no studies that evaluate the impact of DMHL interventions on both proximal and distal mental health outcomes or that consider psychoeducation alone or in conjunction with treatment. Research effort is required to synthesize findings across studies to draw inferences about the impact of DMHL interventions on mental health?specifically, whether DMHL interventions are fundamentally effective (ie, pretest-posttest DMHL intervention comparisons) and more effective than well-controlled conditions (ie, waitlist control and non-DMHL interventions)."
1014,The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Unlike the extensive body of work on health literacy and its relationship to positive health outcomes [2,5,7], research on MHL is more recent and less established in how it relates to or affects mental health functioning [2]. Accelerated by technological advancements and the recent global pandemic, there is burgeoning interest in digital mental health interventions that can be delivered at scale and translate to real-world benefits [8,9]. In particular, recent work has highlighted the use of digital platforms (eg, web-based platforms, apps, and social media) as key facilitators for building digital MHL (DMHL), especially among young people [10,11]. Web-based pedagogies; diverse educational content; and timely interactions with peer supporters, trainers, mental health professionals, and people with common lived experiences of mental illness afforded by digital platforms can effectively promote DMHL [10,11]. As a nascent field, research on DMHL has primarily focused on and been incorporated into mental health interventions, with few observational or field studies documenting DMHL in naturalistic settings in relation to mental health functioning [12,13]."
1015,The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"For theory building, our review and meta-analysis found that DMHL interventions are as effective as face-to-face interventions. DMHL interventions confer optimal effects on mental health when DMHL psychoeducation is combined with informal, nonprofessional active treatment components such as skills training and peer support, which demonstrate comparable effectiveness with that of treatment as usual (client-professional interactions and therapies). These effects, which did not differ by platform type or dosage, were sustained over time. Additionally, most DMHL interventions are found in Western cultural contexts, especially in high-income countries (Global North) such as Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom, and limited research is conducted in low-income countries in Asia and in South American and African countries. Most of the DMHL studies did not report information on the racial or ethnic makeup of the samples. Future work on DMHL interventions that target racial or ethnic minority groups, particularly the design, adoption, and evaluation of the effects of culturally adaptive DMHL interventions on uptake and mental health functioning, is needed. Such evidence can drive the adoption and implementation of DMHL interventions at scale, which represents a key foundation for practice-changing impact in the provision of mental health resources for individuals and the community."
1016,The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,We used a random-effects model to conduct meta-analyses and meta-regressions on moderating effects of DMHL interventions on mental health.
1017,The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Accelerated by technological advancements and the recent global pandemic, there is burgeoning interest in digital mental health literacy (DMHL) interventions that can positively affect mental health. However, existing work remains inconclusive regarding the effectiveness of DMHL interventions."

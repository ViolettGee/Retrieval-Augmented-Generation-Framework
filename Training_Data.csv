0,How do these advanced techniques in AI contribute to improving patient outcomes in mental health care?,"These advanced techniques have the potential to enhance predictive precision, assisting clinicians in obtaining a more nuanced evaluation of individual risk profiles and thereby facilitating earlier and more targeted interventions. Such advancements could significantly improve patient outcomes and further develop management strategies within mental health care.",Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder
1,How do you envision incorporating cognitive functions and additional MRI sequences into future research to enhance the precision in defining suicide risk among BD patients?,"Bearing the above-exposed limitations in mind, we plan to design and conduct future studies including features designed to assess other domains (e.g., adverse life events and traumas), further broader validation samples of patients with BD, as well as transdiagnostic psychiatric cases, to test whether the prediction model's applicability extends across diverse diagnoses [122]. Finally, even though modalities such as cognitive functions or additional MRI sequences have not been implemented in our study, we believe that incorporating them in future research could significantly enhance the precision in defining suicide risk among BD patients.",Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder
2,Could you provide more information on how the sample imbalance (higher number of non-attempters compared to attempters) was addressed in the machine learning model?,"The above-exposed results should be regarded in light of some limitations. First, the sample size is small, although it is in line with similar ML studies [70,�117,�118]. This appears particularly relevant as machine learning needs an important amount of data to be trained properly; therefore, despite having performed a double-nested CV, the risk of overfitting cannot be completely ruled out. ML studies should find a tradeoff between very large databases, often not well characterized, and smaller studies. In our study, we preferred to have a well-characterized sample, although it might pose some problems regarding overfitting. Similarly, the index event (namely, suicide) is luckily a rare occurrence, and this reflects on a highly unbalanced sample, which is a common finding in suicide literature [56]. However, balanced samples (similar size for attempters and non-attempters) are something very far from reality, and we believe it should be avoided. To avoid this bias, we tried to assess this aspect by weighting the hyperplane for uneven groups and considering different metrics, such as sensitivity and specificity, given that accuracy in these cases could be misleading. Another important limitation is the absence of an external validation sample that would confirm the generalizability of our results.",Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder
3,"Can you provide more detail on how the cerebellum is involved in emotional processes and its connection to suicidal behavior, especially in young individuals?","Finally, the cerebellum is increasingly recognized for its involvement in emotional processes [111,�112]. Volumetric alterations of the cerebellum were reported in adults and adolescents with mood disorders and suicide behaviors [113]. Functionally, recent studies suggested an involvement of the cerebellum in the recollection of memories related to suicide attempts. In a recent publication [114], participants who had attempted suicide had greater fMRI task-related activation in visual areas and the cerebellum, with the number of suicide attempts associated with the difference in BOLD response. The cerebellum seems to be also relevant in emotional pain, which can lead to suicidal conduct especially in young individuals [115]. A recent review [116] proposed a model that integrates the previous notions of brain imaging in suicidal studies. In the model, two systems interplay in shaping suicide risk: the emotional pain circuit, including the cerebellum, hippocampus, and amygdala, and the social disconnect circuit, which comprises the lateral OFC and temporal gyri, as well as the connections between them (the frontotemporal system). Emotional pain can be caused by a combination of predisposition and stressful life events and can lead to suicidal ideation, especially in adolescents. If, in addition, the subject is experiencing social disconnect, this can lead to a suicide attempt.",Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder
4,How do the findings regarding frontal regions in suicide attempters align with the role of the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and ventrolateral-prefrontal-insular systems in regulating responses to nonrewarding or aversive experiences?,"With regards to frontal regions, these findings are not surprising as these areas are among the most implicated neural structures in suicidality [72,�96]. The ventral areas of the frontal lobe are essential for guiding goal-directed response selection, especially in unpredictable environments where actions must be adjusted flexibly based on both recent and past reinforcement histories [97]. Notably, in line with the GM loss in the suicide attempters reported by Shao and colleagues, the opercular part of the inferior frontal gyrus resulted among the most selected features. This region is heavily involved in making goal-directed decisions guided by adaptive reinforcement processing [98]. Additionally, these areas show extensive connections with the caudate nucleus [99], which plays a significant role in implementing instrumental processing and goal-directed behaviors [98,�100]. Therefore, our findings support the idea that taking the critical step toward suicide may result from a failure to choose the most beneficial (or least harmful) action in�situations where difficulties appear to overshadow any positive outlook. This notion aligns with the proposed specialized function of the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and ventrolateral-prefrontal-insular systems in signaling and regulating responses to nonrewarding or aversive experiences, which is a key aspect of the broader top-down inhibitory control over emotions, cognition, and actions [101].",Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder
5,How do the results of the study suggest that AI can be utilized in the mental health field to potentially predict and prevent suicide risk more effectively?,"In conclusion, our results confirm some of the previously known risk factors, extensively documented in the literature, as significant contributors in the ML model prediction accuracy, particularly highlighting aspects related to illness severity and history of suicide attempts, either personal or familiar. These results underline the importance of a complete assessment of suicide potentially helping to identify individuals at heightened risk.",Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder
6,"How do atypical antipsychotics affect suicide risk in patients with bipolar disorder, particularly in combination with mood stabilizers during acute phases of the illness?","Given the widespread use of atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of BD, particularly in the management of acute phases where combination therapies with mood stabilizers are considered effective for severe cases, further investigation into the relationship between atypical antipsychotics and suicide risk appears essential [86].",Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder
7,"How do different antiepileptic medications, such as valproate, lithium, lamotrigine, and carbamazepine, vary in their associations with suicide attempts and completions in individuals with mental health conditions?","A recent review of the literature [78] confirmed valproate's therapeutic advantage over no treatment with respect to suicide attempts and completions, though it emphasized the need for further data. However, compared to lithium, valproate has been associated with a higher risk of suicide attempts and completions. Other antiepileptics, such as lamotrigine and carbamazepine, have been noted as requiring further investigation regarding their association with suicide-related outcomes [78].",Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder
8,Could the use of specific medications and compulsory treatment be influenced by AI technology in the future to better understand and manage suicide risk in individuals with severe mental illness?,"In our study, features related to the use of specific medications, such as antiepileptics and atypical antipsychotics (considered as dichotomous variables), as well as chlorpromazine equivalents (treated as a continuous variable), in conjunction with compulsory treatment, may be viewed as proxies for illness severity rather than as direct contributors to increased suicide risk. Intuitively, more severe episodes necessitating complex therapies and a compulsory treatment regimen are likely to be associated with a heightened risk of suicidal behavior.",Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder
9,How do Boudreaux and colleagues suggest that the weights of features may vary over time in relation to suicidal risk susceptibility?,"In this context, it is also worth highlighting, as Boudreaux and colleagues [62] suggested, that the features' weights may vary over time. From this perspective, suicide attempts and suicidal ideation within the past 12?months may contribute significantly more to suicidal risk susceptibility, emphasizing the critical importance of comprehensive clinical assessment and precise, timely monitoring.",Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder
10,Can you provide more detail on the role of depressive polarity in the clinical model and how it is determined or assessed?,"In the clinical model, the most significant features were those related to the history of suicide (suicide attempts lifetime, suicide attempts in the last 12?months, suicide modality, number of suicide attempts lifetime, and suicidal ideation in the last 12?months), to the severity trajectory (6?months composite score), to depressive polarity, to the prescribed treatment (especially use of antiepileptics), and to comorbidities, including alcohol abuse and neurological comorbidities.",Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder
11,Can you provide more details on how the integrated multimodal model combines clinical and MRI data to enhance the prediction of suicide attempts?,"Taking this into consideration, we subsequently combined unimodal prediction into an integrated multimodal model to exploit the different predictive abilities of the two unimodal models. This approach resulted not only in improved overall accuracy but, crucially, in a significant enhancement of sensitivity, with the algorithm correctly predicting 8 suicide attempts out of 10 within the designated time frame. The possibility to enhance the prediction ability by combining clinical and MRI data is in line with the recent study of Shao and colleagues [72], presenting how the addition of MRI may increase the overall classification of suicide attempts in mood disorders. Of note, our study is the first to evaluate this pipeline prospectively, overcoming one of the most common pitfalls of ML prediction of suicidal behaviors: a cross-over design.",Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder
12,How did the combination of clinical and GM modalities improve the sensitivity of the classifier in identifying suicide attempts?,"The multimodal classifier (clinical + GM) reached an AUC of 0.88, BAC 83.4%, sensitivity 80%, and specificity 86.8%. Interestingly, the combination of the 2 modalities allowed for the correct identification of 8 out of 10 suicide attempts, significantly increasing the sensitivity.",Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder
13,What specific reasons were cited for the low prediction accuracy of the thickness model?,"Given the low prediction accuracy, the features' weights of the thickness model were not calculated.",Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder
14,How does the Neurominer model prioritize and weigh the different clinical features in terms of their significance?,"Regarding the clinical features' pool, in the Neurominer model, the most significant features by weight order were: 6?months composite score, lifetime suicide, suicide in the past 12?months, use of antiepileptics, suicide modality,�n. of lifetime attempts, prevalent polarity, use of atypical antipsychotics, suicide ideation in the past 12?months, 3?months composite score, psychiatric family history, alcohol use (actual), chlorpromazine equivalents, compulsory treatment, and neurologic comorbidities. See Figures�S2�and�S3�for further details.",Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder
15,"What specific methods were used to evaluate the performance of the model based on GM volumes data, and how did the model compare to other existing models in terms of its predictive accuracy?","The model based on GM volumes data reached an AUC of 0.86, BAC 76.4%, sensitivity 60%, and specificity 92.8%. Also, in this case, the model was significant with�p?<?0.01 (see Supplementary Figures?Supporting Informations).",Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder
16,How were the morphological parameters extracted from the structural MRI model in this study and what specific brain regions were analyzed?,"A structural MRI model, based on GM volumes and CT features at baseline. Before extracting the morphological parameters, all T1-weighted images were segmented according to GM, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid, bone, soft tissue, and air/background. Second, the Dartel (Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie algebra) (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) tools were then used to determine the nonlinear deformations for registering the GM and white matter images of all subjects. Finally, the resulting images were spatially normalized into the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space and smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian kernel of 6?mm full width at half maximum Gaussian kernel to increase the signal-to-noise ratio and to account for subtle variations in anatomic structures. The total intracranial volume was also extracted using CAT12. Thus, smoothed, modulated, and normalized GM volumes were employed for the extraction of GMV and CT from brain regions defined according to probabilistic atlases. For each subject, mean GMV values were extracted for regions of the volume-based Neuromorphometrics (n?=?136) atlas [63] whereas mean CT values were extracted for regions of the surface-based Desikan-Killiany (n?=?72) atlas [64]. Among them, GMV features from 122 ROIs of the Neuromorphometrics atlas were extracted, after having excluded the ROIs with only white matter (WM). 68 ROIs of the Desikan-Killiany atlas were selected based on the availability of CT regional measures across subjects. The MRI acquisition parameters can be found in the�Supporting Information.",Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder
17,Can you provide more details on how the composite score was calculated and how it was used to predict the patient's trajectory post-discharge?,"Moreover, we created a composite score based on intermediate visits at 1, 3, and 6?months after discharge, including information regarding treatment variations, admissions in the ER, or any other mental health service. All the information regarding an index case (e.g., ER admission due to suicide attempts) was not included in the score, so as not to create bias in the prediction. This score serves as a proxy for the patient's trajectory, mimicking the clinician's assessment (See Supplementary for a complete description).",Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder
18,How were the analyses conducted and what were the results of the study on the impact of AI advancements on mental health?,The analyses and the results were reported following the Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) guidelines [69]. See Table�S2�for the TRIPOD Checklist.,Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder
19,"How does the stacking procedure work in the context of unimodal and multimodal classification, and how does it help in preventing information leakage between training and test samples?","To rule out any information leakage between the training and test samples, we employed the identical repeated k-fold CV scheme for unimodal and multimodal classification. The stacking procedure started by combining decision scores of the individual classifiers' committees within a given CV1 partition, standardizing the resulting matrices, and subsequently using them as new sets of predictive features, which replaced the original features in a given CV1 partition.",Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder
20,How was the discriminative utility of the input variables determined within the unimodal classifiers?,"To measure the discriminative utility of the input variables within each unimodal classifier, we computed the probability of being selected for classification purposes within the inner cross-validation loop for each feature [66].",Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder
21,Can you explain how the SVM algorithm was adjusted for the unbalance between the suicide and non-suicide patient groups in the study?,"A Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used as the algorithm of choice. SVM is considered among the best-performing algorithms in psychiatric complex problems�[56,�65] and one of the easiest to interpret. Given the unbalance between the groups (suicide vs. non-suicide patients), the hyperplane was weighted for uneven group sizes, therefore minimizing the risk that the algorithm might predict only non-suicide patients (the larger group). The C parameter was optimized within a range (11 parameters, from 0.015625 to 16).",Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder
22,"How were the variables scaled to a [0,1] range?","Each variable was scaled to a [0,1] range.",Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder
23,How was imputation specifically implemented using the Euclidean distance between the 7-nearest observations for handling missing data?,Imputation was performed for missing data using Euclidean distance between the 7-nearest observations.,Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder
24,Can you elaborate on the specific feature engineering pipelines that were applied to the clinical models within the CV scheme?,"Inside the CV scheme, the following feature engineering pipelines were applied to the clinical models:",Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder
25,How was the integration of MRI information with the clinical model specifically carried out to assess its impact on prediction performance?,"The overall analytic strategy (Figure�1) entailed initially quantifying the unimodal prognostic performance of each classifier (clinical, GM volumes, CT), and subsequently understanding whether integrating MRI information with the clinical model would improve prediction performance. Therefore, four unimodal models were created (two clinical models, with and without composite score, one with GM volumes as features, and one with CT as features). All the ML analyses were performed with Neurominer version 1.1 for Matlab (Nikolaos Koutsouleris, Munich, Germany; see�https://github.com/neurominer-git).",Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder
26,How can advanced ML techniques improve the accuracy of suicide risk prediction and contribute to more personalized interventions in clinical settings?,"By employing a prospective approach and leveraging advanced ML techniques, our research intends to enhance the accuracy of suicide risk prediction and to facilitate more timely and personalized interventions, potentially informing more effective prevention and treatment strategies in clinical settings, thereby improving patient outcomes.",Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder
27,How do the time-variant variables in the study account for the varying influence of recent versus historical aspects of the disorder on the mental health outcomes examined?,"To address these limitations, our study adopts a prospective design with a 12-month observation period, using a multimodal approach integrating clinical data with MRI features and incorporating time-variant variables, accounting for the varying influence of recent versus historical aspects of the disorder.",Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder
28,"How specifically have machine learning algorithms been utilized in analyzing and integrating extensive datasets in the context of bipolar disorder research, and what kind of complex patterns and correlations have been uncovered as a result?","In this context, machine learning (ML) is emerging as a promising technology. By analyzing and integrating extensive datasets, including clinical, neuroimaging, behavioral, and genetic information, ML algorithms have been proven increasingly useful in uncovering complex patterns and correlations. Recent studies have demonstrated the use of ML in investigating BD, improving diagnostic accuracy [51,�52], and predicting depressive relapses [53] and adverse outcomes [54], including suicidal behavior [55].",Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder
29,"How can advancements in AI potentially help in predicting and preventing suicide in patients with bipolar disorder, considering the current limitations in identifying reliable biomarkers for this purpose?","However, despite the identified risk factors, predicting and thereby preventing suicide in patients with bipolar disorder remains a considerable challenge in clinical practice, primarily due to the lack of reliable and verified biomarkers that can accurately and promptly signal the risk of suicidal behavior [46-48].",Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder
30,How do early adverse life events and ongoing adverse life circumstances contribute to suicidal behavior in individuals with bipolar disorder?,"Several factors have been extensively studied and identified as potential contributors to suicidal behavior in individuals with BD. Sociodemographic variables such as male gender and age (particularly those under 35 or over 75), caucasian ethnicity, marital and familial status (e.g., being divorced, living alone, or having no children), and unemployment have been associated to an increased risk of suicide [4,�6,�24-30]. Furthermore, early adverse life events?including experiences of separation, emotional, physical, and sexual abuse?along with acute psychosocial stressors, like the death or separation from a significant other, loss of health, possessions, autonomy, employment, educational opportunities, or financial stability, and ongoing adverse life circumstances, have been implicated in precipitating suicidal behavior [4,�6,�24,�27,�31-34]. Additionally, as emphasized in Mann and colleagues' stress-diathesis model [35], a predisposition to suicide may also stem from genetic vulnerability, impaired serotonergic functioning, and specific temperamental traits, including aggressiveness, impulsivity, and hopelessness [11,�27,�28,�30,�35].",Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder
31,How do psychiatric conditions impact an individual's risk for suicidal behavior?,"Undoubtedly, psychiatric conditions are significant risk factors for suicidal behavior. Wide-ranging research indicates that almost 90% of the attempted and completed suicides have been committed by individuals suffering from at least one Axis I psychiatric disorder, often un- or misdiagnosed and treated [4-11].",Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder
32,How did combining multiple models help in increasing the sensitivity of detecting suicide attempts in the study?,"By combining models, we increased the detection of suicide attempts, reaching a sensitivity of 80%. Combining more than one modality proved a valid method to overcome limitations from single-modality models and increasing overall accuracy.",Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder
33,How did the researchers determine which clinical and demographic features to extract from the digital health records for analysis in differentiating BD subjects who attempted suicide?,"A sample of 163 BD patients were recruited and followed up for 12?months. Gray matter volumes and cortical thickness were extracted from the T1-weighted images. Based on previous literature, we extracted 56 clinical and demographic features from digital health records. Support Vector Machine was used to differentiate BD subjects who attempted suicide. First, we explored single modality prediction (clinical features, GM, and thickness). Second, we implemented a multimodal stacking-based data fusion framework.",Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder
34,"Can you provide more information about the specific methodologies used in the study, such as how Geographic Information System and unsupervised machine learning analyses were employed to predict poor mental health outcomes?","Understanding the complex interplay between SRD and mental health is vital to informing public health policies and interventions. For example, acknowledging that SRD places additional burdens on an individual?s ability to cope with life?s demands calls for targeted support in areas such as mental health services, education, employment, and community infrastructure. Our study, deploying advanced Geographic Information System and unsupervised machine learning analyses, unravels complex spatiotemporal relationships predicting poor mental health while excluding explicit race-related variables. The findings highlight that the risk for poor mental health is intertwined with structural and spatially localized factors that correspond with disproportional racial representation within communities. These insights illustrate a need for reinvestment strategies that recognize, protect, and promote mental health, with a focus on communities disproportionately affected by SRD. Such strategies must be implemented in a manner that considers the multifaceted risks and includes protections against further exacerbating disparities. In an era where mental health disparities persist, our research emphasizes the importance of a targeted and localized approach, prioritizing communities with historical burdens of discrimination, ensuring equitable access to resources, and ultimately fostering a more resilient and inclusive mental health care system.",Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis
35,Can you provide examples of factors that have been found to be associated with mental health disparities in the study?,"While our approach introduces innovative methods for analyzing mental health disparities, it is crucial to acknowledge the inherent limitations of observational studies. Such limitations highlight the need for caution in interpreting causality from our findings. Our study?s results, therefore, should be considered indicative of associations rather than definitive causal relationships. For example, the relationships of several factors with mental health (eg, smoking, sleep deprivation, and unemployment) are likely bidirectional. This acknowledgment is vital in guiding future research and formulating public health policies that are based on a comprehensive understanding of mental health determinants.",Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis
36,"How do individual factors such as unemployment, lack of insurance, sleep deprivation, and smoking contribute to mental health issues in more affluent and socioeconomically secure areas in Milwaukee's lakefront communities?","Although high-risk clusters showed high spatial alignment with socioeconomically disadvantaged communities in Milwaukee, several individual factors were strong predictors of mental health in more affluent and socioeconomically secure areas (eg, in Milwaukee?s lakefront communities). These include unemployment, lack of insurance, sleep deprivation, and smoking. These observations suggest that while these communities are not locations of high-risk clusters, mental health associations are evident in subgroups of community members.",Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis
37,"How do sleep deprivation and unemployment specifically impact mental health in central city neighborhoods versus affluent shoreline areas of Milwaukee County, as mentioned in the study?","Sleep deprivation and unemployment were identified as significant predictors of mental health [30-32]; sleep deprivation is a stronger predictor of poor mental health in central city neighborhoods and northern parts of Milwaukee County but is less of a predictor in southern communities. Our study shows that community employment has a strong negative association with poor mental health, but the relationship plateaus after 52% employment prevalence. Employment is more predictive of poor mental health in both the central city neighborhoods and the affluent shoreline areas of Milwaukee County.",Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis
38,How does the lack of health insurance specifically impact mental health in central and northern neighborhoods of Milwaukee City compared to other areas?,"Access to health insurance is vital for mental health resource use. Our analysis emphasizes the necessity of removing structural barriers to mental health such as insurance coverage [27,28]. We find a strong correlation between poor mental health and the percentage of adults without health insurance. However, the trend flattens at a 16.6% prevalence of poor mental health, indicating that when more than 20% of a community lacks health insurance, other factors may contribute to poor mental health. The lack of health insurance affects mental health more significantly in central and northern neighborhoods of Milwaukee City.",Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis
39,Can you provide examples of how the integration of advanced geospatial and machine learning techniques in analyzing mental health disparities offers a more detailed understanding compared to traditional methods?,"Our study introduces a novel approach to analyzing mental health disparities and their structural underpinnings, diverging from traditional models. By integrating advanced geospatial and machine learning techniques, it provides a more granular, community-specific insight into these disparities. This method contrasts with conventional approaches that may not fully capture the intricate, locality-specific interactions of factors impacting mental health [8]. In line with the study by Groos et al [8] based on the exploration of structural racism quantification methods, this study exemplifies the shift toward more sophisticated, nuanced methodologies in understanding the complex effects of SRD on health outcomes.",Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis
40,"What specific factors contribute to the spatial dependency observed in mental health outcomes, and how do they interact with each other to potentially impact mental well-being within communities?","Although generated without incorporating location as a factor,�Figure 4�demonstrates spatial autocorrelation, signifying the presence of spatial dependency in mental health outcomes. This suggests that mental health issues are not randomly distributed but rather display geographically linked patterns. Spatial dependency confirms the influence of location or spatial context on mental health. Our results align with previous findings, further demonstrating that mental health outcomes are partly a product of spatially located phenomena such as socioeconomic conditions, access to health care, environmental factors, and SRD. The observations reinforce the assertion that conventional global models are not ideal for examining complex phenomena such as community mental health or SRD [19,23]. Local spatial modeling offers more precise outcomes when processes are affected by both their geographical location and the fluctuating conditions of underlying variables across different times and locations.",Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis
41,"Can you provide more information on how the findings of the unsupervised approach suggest that disparities in mental health outcomes align with racial demographics in Milwaukee County, even though race-related factors were not explicitly considered in the analysis?","The findings of our unsupervised approach demonstrate significant mental health disparities that align with the racial demographics in Milwaukee County, despite our exclusion of race-related factors. The overrepresentation of Black populations in the high-risk cluster combined with the overrepresentation of the White population in the low-risk cluster indicates that disparities observed across clusters are not isolated occurrences but rather are indicative of underlying socioeconomic disparities likely caused by structural racism and discrimination. Notably, while Hispanic community members were underrepresented in the low-risk cluster 1 and overrepresented in the moderate-risk cluster 2, they were underrepresented in the high-risk cluster 3. This highlights that there are differences across racial minority demographics that influence mental health. For example, differences in upward financial mobility have been identified between Black and Hispanic communities [22].",Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis
42,Can you explain why the disproportionality index is higher for the White population in the low-risk group compared to the Black and Hispanic populations?,"To examine racial disparities within community clusters, we calculated a disproportionality index, the ratio of the percentage of a specific racial demographic within each cluster compared with that within a base population. Within the low-risk group (cluster 1), the disproportionality index is 1.5 for the White population, indicating an overrepresentation; the Black and Hispanic populations are underrepresented with indices of 0.21 and 0.6, respectively.",Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis
43,How did the integration of k-means clustering further enhance the grouping of census tracts based on similarities in mental health-related factors?,"A SOM approach was used to determine impactful clusters of the 12 most significant place-based factors related to mental health. Census tracts were grouped based on similarities in these mental health?related factors. The SOM was integrated with k-means clustering to further delineate and group census tracts based on their similarity. The original 25 SOM grid codes were condensed into 3 clusters, depicted in�Figure 3. Each cluster represents a collection of census tracts displaying similar patterns or characteristics across the 12 mental health?related factors. Clusters 1, 2, and 3 differ markedly in their composition, each corresponding to varying levels of mental health risk. Although a more detailed understanding of each cluster necessitates additional data, particularly in terms of specific demographic, socioeconomic, and environmental variables that may influence these risk levels, these clusters can be generally categorized as representing high (cluster 3), moderate (cluster 2), and low (cluster 1) risk for poor mental health. This categorization is based on the aggregated mental health factors within each cluster. Deeper analysis with more comprehensive data could reveal more nuanced distinctions and cluster-specific contributing factors.",Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis
44,Can you provide more details on how the partial dependence plots were used to analyze the relationship between the 12 predictive variables and poor mental health?,"Partial dependence plots depicting the relationship of each of the 12 predictive variables for poor mental health were constructed.�Figure 1�illustrates the correlation between the selected 12 variables and poor mental health. The results of the partial dependence plot approach showed that the relationship among the prevalence of smoking, poverty, insufficient sleep, lack of health insurance, single households, sedentariness, and poor mental health was positive. In contrast, the childhood opportunity index, median age, homeownership, and employment rate exhibit negative relationships with poor mental health. Notably, obesity and educational attainment did not follow linear trends in relation to poor mental health, illustrating the complexity of these factors. The largest difference makers were the prevalence of smoking, lack of insurance, poverty, insufficient sleep, employment, and age.",Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis
45,Could you explain the process of variable selection (VSURF) in more detail and how it was applied to the 105 uncorrelated factors?,"We compiled a database of 217 geospatial determinants of health across behavioral indicators, built environment, sociocultural environment, and health care to analyze the relationship between place-based factors and mental health. Next, we excluded all race-based factors and used the remaining 184 variables to identify highly colinear variables, VIF, and Pearson correlation analysis was applied (VIF threshold=7.5; Pearson correlation threshold=0.75). As a result, 105 uncorrelated factors were selected to be used as the input for the variable selection (VSURF) procedure.",Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis
46,Can you explain further how the SOM model combined with k-means clustering was used to analyze the data set of census tracts and determine optimal clusters for the factors related to poor mental health in Milwaukee County?,"Self-organizing maps (SOMs) are unsupervised artificial ?neural? networks that create a 2D space topographic map of a data set. ?Neurons,? or relational clusters, are organized to preserve their context or neighborhood, and SOMs use closeness or neighborhood function to display input space properties. We implemented a SOM model to explore a data set containing 296 census tracts in Milwaukee County?12 determinant factors of poor mental health. The SOM was trained on this data set using a 5?5 hexagonal grid, selected for its ability to create a more comprehensive and representative map of the data. After training the SOM, we delved deeper into the clusters formed on the map by combining the SOM with k-means clustering, an algorithm known for its efficiency in partitioning data into distinct groups or clusters. We determined the optimal number of clusters for our data set by evaluating the ?within-cluster sums of squares? and the ?average silhouette? statistics [21].",Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis
47,How does the geographically weighted random forest (GWRF) model differ from traditional global modeling approaches in analyzing the relationship between place-based risk factors and the prevalence of poor mental health?,"Spatial modeling enables the examination of how variables behave across geographical space to identify spatial heterogeneity and dependence. Local spatial modeling offers a more informed approach to understanding complex phenomena compared with conventional global approaches [19]. The geographically weighted random forest (GWRF), a localized model, is ideal for conducting public health research. However, GWRF has not been used to examine the variability in relationships between place-based risk factors and the prevalence of poor mental health. This study used GWRF to investigate nonstationarity and localized associations between risk factors and the prevalence of poor mental health.",Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis
48,How can tree-based methods like random forest improve variable selection in public health research compared to conventional techniques?,"Variable selection minimizes the number of predictors in quantitative models to improve efficiency and reduce complexity. Public health research commonly uses conventional techniques such as subject matter expert selection and regression-based stepwise selection. However, tree-based methods such as random forest can handle nonlinear, nonparametric relationships and provide more robust results [15].",Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis
49,How has the declaration of racism as a public health crisis in Milwaukee County impacted efforts to address health disparities among the Black population in the area?,"Our study site is Milwaukee County (population of 918,661), the most populous county in Wisconsin, with a racially diverse population of Black (n=241,608, 26.3%), Hispanic or Latino (n=143,311, 15.6%), and White origin (n=541,091, 58.9%) [13]. The county includes the hypersegregated city of Milwaukee (population 563,305), where redlining confined the African American population to its central city neighborhoods. Devastated by deindustrialization and disinvestments, these neighborhoods exhibit concentrated urban poverty, heightened sociospatial inequalities, and dramatic health disparities [14], where Black residents experience a poverty rate 5 times higher than that of White residents and White residents outlive Black residents by almost 14 years [13]. Acknowledging the damaging legacy of SRD on health, Milwaukee County was among the first jurisdictions in the United States to declare racism as a public health crisis in 2019, with 170 jurisdictions following its suit.",Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis
50,"As a student interested in the implications of advancements in AI on mental health, can you provide more information on how using an unsupervised retrospective approach can help identify communities experiencing structural racism and mental health disparities without reference to race?","To examine the contribution of SRD to inequalities, various measures have been used including racial residential segregation [8]. However, as no domain of structural racism operates in isolation, multiple index measures of SRD have been created and applied. Dougherty et al [9] developed a structural racism index measure by combining 7 measures of SRD: housing dissimilarity index, school dissimilarity index, high school graduation ratio, incarceration ratio, poverty ratio, primary care ratio, and ambulatory care ratio. Still, there are no consistent, agreed-upon relevant content domains of structural racism [10]. Instead of selecting 1 approach or developing yet another index, we examined mental health disparities without reference to race to determine whether communities experiencing SRD can be identified using an unsupervised retrospective approach.",Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis
51,"How does systemic or institutional racism and societal norms, as described in the text, contribute to disparities in mental health outcomes among historically marginalized communities in the United States?","Structural Racism and Discrimination (SRD) is a fundamental determinant of health disparities and poor health outcomes among historically marginalized communities in the United States [1]. SRD refers to systemic or institutional racism and societal norms that constrain the chances, resources, influence, and welfare of people and communities due to their racial and ethnic background and other characteristics. Racial segregation in urban centers is an outcome of SRD-driven policy inequalities such as discriminatory mortgage lending practices (redlining), confining Black Americans to central city neighborhoods, which became sites of concentrated poverty and heightened inequities. Residents of segregated neighborhoods experience disproportionate exposure, susceptibility, and vulnerability to economic and social inequality, environmental pollution, toxic substances, and unsafe conditions, thereby affecting individual health conditions, health practices, and access to health care services [2]. Further, neighborhood-level racial and ethnic segregation determines and limits access to educational, employment, and health-related resources [1]. Studies have emphasized the significance of neighborhood segregation on health inequity [3].",Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis
52,How did the study determine that predominantly African American neighborhoods were disproportionately affected by poor mental health clusters compared to other communities?,"While 12 influential factors collectively accounted for 95.11% of the variability in mental health across communities, the top 6 factors?smoking, poverty, insufficient sleep, lack of health insurance, employment, and age?were particularly impactful. Predominantly, African American neighborhoods were disproportionately affected, which is 2.23 times more likely to encounter high-risk clusters for poor mental health.",Exploring the Association Between Structural Racism and Mental Health: Geospatial and Machine Learning Analysis

54,How can cutting edge technologies be utilized to address stigma and shame surrounding mental health in conservative communities?,"It is clear that stigma and shame are a major stumbling block to accessing mental health services in conservative communities. Unfortunately, the stigma extends beyond the individual to their family members, exacerbating the shame they feel. In addition, the healthcare workers who are expected to support those with mental health difficulties also sometimes contribute toward the stigma and feelings of shame, leading to further discouraging patients from seeking assistance. This situation requires a range of responses to address the problem within an environment where mental health problems are on the rise. Such responses should be culturally relevant, religiously appropriate, informative and educational, and utilize cutting edge technologies.",Mental health stigma: a conundrum for healthcare practitioners in conservative communities
55,"As a student fascinated by the potential impact of AI on mental health, I would like to know more about the integration of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) into chatbots for mental health support mentioned in the text. How does this integration work, and what are some potential benefits and challenges of using chatbots to deliver CBT-based therapy?","With regard to the future of mental health, including in conservative communities, Van Daele et al. (35) state there is a demand for digital therapy that uses psychological theories and methods to interface technology with healthcare to support mental wellness. Furthermore, some have suggested that technology could serve as a bridge between PWMI and healthcare staff or therapists by, as the case may be, offering relief and comfort (35). Cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT, is a treatment that aims to help people modify their thought processes and behaviors in order to improve their mental health, and its approaches have been integrated into chatbots for mental health. Furthermore, Haque (31) suggests embedding indigenous psychologies to decolonize approaches and ensure culturally appropriate treatment, including Islamic psychology, which considers the nature of the human soul, the development of personality, and the evil eye. This should lead to more rounded solutions and support that is accepted by the communities in which it is offered.",Mental health stigma: a conundrum for healthcare practitioners in conservative communities
56,How do deeply held beliefs and practices among healthcare workers in conservative communities like Saudi Arabia impact access to mental healthcare for individuals with mental illness?,"Could it be based on these beliefs and practices that some HCWs transfer deeply held views about mental illness in their dealings with those who seek mental health services? Or could it be based on ignorance or poor mental health education among HCW? In conservative communities such as Saudi Arabia, multiple factors may apply, including the diverse background of HCWs, inadequacies of training and, indeed, the influence of culture (32,�33). However, the bottom line is the overall impact of this on limiting access to mental healthcare and the potential to drive PWMI toward the patronage of substandard care (10,�34).",Mental health stigma: a conundrum for healthcare practitioners in conservative communities
57,"How does the influence of religious convictions in conservative communities like those in the Middle East and North Africa region impact mental health stigma and access to mental healthcare, specifically in a country like Saudi Arabia?","One may argue that there is a contextual basis for the experiences around mental health, which may be due to variations in culture and religion, or purely based on individual differences (22). For instance, there are those who fervently believe that religious convictions can solidify attitudes that shape or form views expressed by individuals (24,�28). In conservative communities, such as some across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, mental health stigma is a prominent topic of concern. This is due in part to its influence on access to mental healthcare, as well as its impact on medical practices in general. Saudi Arabia may be considered as a prime example of one of these communities.",Mental health stigma: a conundrum for healthcare practitioners in conservative communities
58,Can you provide more information on how healthcare workers have been implicated in barriers to access for people with mental health issues due to their negative attitudes?,"As expected, the health system is supposed to be a haven for people with mental healthcare needs, but structurally, the gaps in the system allow PWMI to fall through the cracks, and for various reasons, HCWs have been implicated in barriers to access for many PWMI through their negative attitudes (21). Furthermore, Knaak et al. (22) explain that stigmatizing attitudes toward mental health suffers are consistent across the stages of healthcare delivery and provision. This is a conundrum that requires further analysis, because in consideration of academic scholarship, and in relation to the general population, HCWs should set a positive example in matters relating to mental health. Indeed, we must consider the opposite argument where there is strong support for HCWs in their capacity as role models and positive change agents and advocates for PWMI (23). However, due to the key role of HCWs in ensuring the best possible care for those who need it, even a singular negative report in this regard is one too many.",Mental health stigma: a conundrum for healthcare practitioners in conservative communities
59,"How do cultural traditions and prejudices contribute to the negative attitudes towards mental health, and how do these factors impact the way healthcare workers interact with individuals with mental illness?","The reasons for these negative attitudes toward mental health have been shown to have multiple origins that include culture and tradition, prejudice, and ignorance (12). Although this pattern of behavior is common in many societies, it is often more pronounced among culturally reserved, conservative communities (13), where traditional practices and doctrines have shaped how healthcare workers (HCWs) receive and relate to their clients. Similarly, it has become common place in the literature for authors to draw a link between level of education, mental health literacy and mental health stigma and shame (10,�12,�14). Based on these associations, it has been suggested that mental health stigma is less problematic in populations with higher levels of education or among societies that have high levels of mental health literacy (15). Therefore, it is plausible that knowledge about mental health may provide insights into how individuals perceive and manage mental illness, as well as how the general public interacts with those who suffer from it (16). Despite this, in reality, positive attitudes around PWMI do not always correlate with higher levels of education (17,�18).",Mental health stigma: a conundrum for healthcare practitioners in conservative communities
60,How exactly can artificial intelligence be utilized to directly mitigate the stigma surrounding mental health conditions in conservative communities?,"A deep understanding of conservative communities and the persistence of the stigma around mental health is essential to ensuring the wellbeing of individuals and the functioning of society as a whole. Therefore, this review of mental health stigma in conservative communities, and the problems faced by the public and healthcare practitioners, adds to the knowledge in this area, and it may be useful in informing future research pathways and findings solutions. Furthermore, while education and ?changing the cultural narrative around mental health? [(6), p. 1920] is essential, novel approaches are also needed to directly mitigate the stigma related to mental health conditions. As we enter into the fourth industrial revolution, new digital options and technologies such as artificial intelligence may provide unique solutions.",Mental health stigma: a conundrum for healthcare practitioners in conservative communities
61,How have health systems in conservative communities around the world been addressing the stigma surrounding mental health and the association of mental health with shame?,"This paper presents perspectives on the stigma around mental health in conservative communities, and the association of mental health with shame that is being dealt with by many health systems around the world. This is particularly apparent within developing countries and areas where cultural values and practices may influence treatment options. For example, Elshamy et al. (1) conducted a systematic review of 16 qualitative studies into mental health seeking behaviors in Middle Eastern countries (typically conservative communities), and they discovered negative attitudes toward mental health, including stigma and shame. Furthermore, in a cross-cultural comparison of mental illness stigma and help-seeking attitudes conducted across 16 Arab countries, Fekih-Romdhane et al. (2) found that out of 10,036 respondents, one in four held stigmatizing attitudes toward mental health and negative attitudes toward seeking support.",Mental health stigma: a conundrum for healthcare practitioners in conservative communities
62,Can you provide more detail on how the beHEALTHIER platform integrates different types of healthcare data to construct effective health policies and how this could be applied to mental healthcare specifically?,"Nevertheless, our work aspires to bring significant implications for stakeholders, including researchers, mental healthcare professionals, and individuals with MH disorders. Our overview of current methodologies for handling multimodal data serves as a starting point for future MH researchers to explore methodological advancements for more effective and timely detection approaches. Our guidelines for data source selection provide a systematic approach for researchers to make informed decisions aligned with use cases or specific symptoms of interest. In addition, our critical analysis of passive multimodal data sources and modality-specific features provides insights to explore the effectiveness of other modality combinations for specific MH disorders. Subsequently, this inspires the development of specific tools that leverage external or multiple data sources to support mental healthcare professionals in their clinical practice (e.g., drawing inspiration from the beHEALTHIER platform [319] which integrates different types of healthcare data, including health, social care, and clinical signs, to construct effective health policies). We envision engaging with MH professionals through workshops, webinars, or other collaborative efforts to bridge the gap between research and practice. Additionally, our practical insights emphasize implementing ML approaches in real-world settings, paving the way for practical implementations that enhance the accessibility for individuals with MH disorders. The outcomes related to the correlation between specific inferred behaviors and MH symptoms also contribute to a better understanding of MH symptoms. Moving forward, we anticipate close collaboration with mental healthcare professionals and individuals with specific MH disorders to design a multimodal approach that facilitates more effective detection. Regardless, we acknowledge the need to establish a middle ground to effectively communicate technical concepts and implications to both stakeholder groups.",Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches

Given the complexity of identifying the most effective data source for detecting MH disorders, our guidelines offer a systematic approach for future researchers to make informed decisions about a data source that aligns with research objectives, is relevant to the target population, and adheres to ethical standards. In addition, our analysis highlights the potential of neural network architecture in model-level fusion for capturing higher-complexity cross-modality interactions. We also observe the prospect of utilizing such architectures as ML algorithms to handle high-dimensional data, though practical aspects, such as complexity, explainability, and generalizability, should be scrutinized beyond effectiveness.",Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches

69,"What ethical considerations are involved in utilizing social media data for research purposes, especially in relation to privacy and consent of the users?","The acceptance of social media users for researchers to utilize their data for research purposes is also controversial. Researchers have presumed that social media users are open to and permit others to access their data since they opted to make it public in the first place [318]. Even though users have complete control of their public content, they are unaware and may oppose their data being accessed and analyzed for research without consent. Meanwhile, we hypothesize that audio-visual recordings are the least acceptable because it is highly invasive, and not all individuals are comfortable having their footage taken and monitored continuously. Even though existing research [313] found a general acceptance of being recorded using privacy-preserving video cameras that only capture participants? silhouettes, such cameras may not apply to the current context that requires identifiable elements, like facial expressions, body gestures, and movements. Researchers have complete control of the data collection process, and there were contradictory opinions from participants themselves on whether they should have control over when and what is being recorded, e.g., by allowing them to pause at specific critical times [313].",Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches
70,How do people's perceptions and concerns about data collection methods impact their willingness to participate in research involving human data?,"The general acceptability of people towards specific data collection approaches has the most direct influence on research involving human data. This criterion can be attributed to people?s openness and comfortability in allowing their data to be collected, which are often supported by their perceptions and concerns about the methods. The control they have over the sharing of their data may also be a contributing factor.",Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches
71,"Can you explain how social media data can be used in mental health research, and what types of insights can be gained from analyzing this data?","We deduced that social media data are the cheapest to acquire from all aspects above. It is the most accessible since researchers can crawl public data online without accessing users individually or getting hold of their private information, given that they comply with the platforms? terms and conditions (whether this is deemed ethical is another question). Relatively small processing power and storage space are required since crawled data is in the form of data entries. Additionally, features can be extracted from textual and visual content using processing tools available, such as LIWC [278], NLTK [280], and SEANCE [282] for texts and OpenFace [269], OpenCV [270], and OpenPose [271] for images. Audio-visual recordings are the most costly because they encapsulate rich data information that requires large storage space and extensive computation power to process audio and visual elements. In addition, this approach requires video cameras and microphones, which might have to be purchased beforehand, and consumes more effort in setting up the equipment at one or more locations based on device reception and coverage.",Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches
72,Can you provide some examples of how clinical validation can be incorporated into establishing a reliable ground truth for social media data analysis in the context of mental health?,"A reliable ground truth should always be supported by clinical validation, such as through a diagnosis by trained practitioners, reference of clinical evidence, or having clinical experts verify manual annotations, since relevant clinical knowledge is necessary to ensure the validity of ground-truth labels. Specifically, in the use case of social media data, where individuals? data were crawled directly from these platforms, there are both practical and ethical considerations that need to be addressed when claiming a ground truth has been established. While time-consuming, future studies could consider ways to directly approach social media users where possible to verify their MH states and to actively gain their consent for their data to be used (or ensure that users are aware of the research aims at the very least).",Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches
73,"How can unrealistic ground truth impact the accuracy of mental health detection in AI systems, and what are the potential dangers associated with this in relation to crisis points in mental health disorders?","A well-justified ground truth is vital to represent people?s actual MH states. From a responsible innovation perspective, unrealistic ground truth can cause under or over-estimations in MH detection, which may escalate to introduce dangers, especially in disorders with crisis points, such as suicidal ideation or an eating disorder.",Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches
74,How can the use of smartphone and wearable sensor data enhance the accuracy and reliability of monitoring participants' behaviors and activities in the context of mental health research?,"We perceived that smartphone and wearable sensor data are the most reliable due to their ubiquity and a lower possibility of people ?tricking? sensors into gathering perceivably desired data. Prior to data collection, participants will configure dedicated mobile applications in their smartphones, allow permission to access specific sensor data, and establish wireless connections for wearable devices to their smartphones, where applicable. Afterwards, they will interact with their devices as usual throughout the data collection process with minimal active inputs. Given that they are open to and allow monitoring over a longer period, the awareness of monitoring may be reduced following the initial novelty effect, thereby enhancing the ?honesty? of corresponding data. Nevertheless, researchers should consider data quality that can be affected by sensors of different devices with varying sensitivity. The fit of wearable devices may also affect the accuracy and amount of data collected. For example, improper wearing or wearables slipping off [313] during sleep may end up collecting poor, noisy data. In addition, participants may forget to reapply sensors (e.g., following a shower) or feel discomfort from wearing it on their wrists or other parts of their body.",Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches

76,Can you explain more about how transparency and explainability in ML models can help healthcare professionals in making clinical decisions in high-stake mental health applications?,"In addition, with the growing attention to the interpretability and explainability of ML models [299], these criteria offer transparency to ML models? decision-making to establish trust in these algorithms and elevate their practicality in real-life applications. Specifically, in high-stake MH applications where black-box predictions potentially bring harmful consequences, explanations of ML outputs can provide meaningful insights for healthcare professionals to understand and validate the relevance of ML outputs in complementing clinical diagnosis. Considering the inherent biases in ML algorithms [310], transparency in working mechanisms (local explainability), feature contributions (global explainability [299]), and potential shortcomings are necessary for healthcare professionals to guide and manage the influence of ML outputs on clinical decisions.",Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches
77,How can the application of LSTM-based models to hourly time series sensor data potentially improve the understanding and prediction of mental health outcomes compared to conventional univariate approaches?,"Despite both audio-visual and sensor data being time series data, we noticed relatively limited applications of NN architectures on sensor data. Most studies employed conventional linear or statistical ML algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, SVM, XGBoost), which learn from univariate inputs, by aggregating extracted features across the whole duration. Such approaches potentially neglected the associations of features across time since several recent studies [162,170,176] proved the superiority of NN-based models applied to higher-dimensional time series sensor data, where features are aggregated at hourly, daily, or weekly features, over conventional univariate approaches. These outcomes suggested an aspect worth investigating for future researchers to better harness the potential of ML algorithms, for example, by applying an LSTM-based model to hourly time series data and RF to univariate features derived from the prior data to leverage the strengths of both algorithms [208].",Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches
78,Can you explain how the CASER architecture used convolutional filters in both horizontal and vertical layers to capture sequential patterns and feature-level patterns for recommendation systems?,"We have observed an increased adoption of various NN architectures among researchers to model feature information at varying complexity levels. Several architectures have shown outstanding efficacy by incorporating both temporal and contextual interactions within and across modalities, underscoring the importance of generating fused representations that encapsulate such information. For instance, Yan et al. [170] applied Convolutional Sequence Embedding Recommendation (CASER) [309], which leverages convolutional filters of CNNs. In CASER?s horizontal convolutional layer, the authors applied convolutional filters horizontally to capture daily-level sequential patterns as local features for all feature points at the previous time step, followed by max-pooling to extract the most meaningful information. In the vertical convolutional layer, feature-level patterns were generated as the weighted sum of each feature point at specific time steps, with the convolutional filter acting as weights. The outputs of both convolutional layers were then concatenated into fully-connected layers to produce fused representations. This architecture demonstrated more effective capture of hidden series patterns than aggregated statistical features (e.g., average, minimum, or maximum across a duration). In contrast, Zhou et al. [93] proposed a time-aware attention multimodal fusion (TAMF) network. This architecture includes a sparse MLP, utilizing its weight sharing and sparse connections to mix information from modality-specific representations in both vertical and horizontal directions. The resulting outcome is a mixed attention vector, which is separated into attention vectors of each modality. The final fused representations were obtained by summing modality-specific representations weighted by respective attention vectors. TAMF was claimed to model the importance of different modalities at different times, with well-rounded consideration of cross-modality interactions.",Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches
79,"How can feature-level fusion be applied to analyze and understand patterns in individuals' physical behaviors, and how can this information be used to potentially improve mental health outcomes?","Feature-level fusion is readily applicable to simple univariate features, where direct concatenation is straightforward and efficient to implement. Researchers should align their decision with research objectives by considering whether the features succinctly capture the information they intend to investigate with sufficient details and the capability of adopted ML algorithms to model the correlation among such features to answer specific research questions. For example, a high-level aggregation by computing the average steps, distance traveled, and time spent at an individual?s home across the entire study duration produces a simple univariate vector representation for feature-level fusion, but such information may not be relevant for a study intending to capture daily variations in individuals? physical behaviors. If researchers intend to prioritize efficiency and low computational complexity, specific computation methods should be investigated to effectively elicit low-dimensional representations that capture time-based variations. For instance, autocorrelation analysis captures feature periodicities across specific durations [157] where the resulting correlation coefficients could be utilized as higher-level representations of time series data.",Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches
80,What are some of the specific criteria that are used to evaluate data collection approaches in the context of mental health and AI advancements?,"In addition to modality-specific effectiveness, discussed in�Section 3.3, there is a need for deeper considerations beyond data source, which are associated with the experimental contexts of data collection approaches and the individuals to which the data belong. We established several criteria to evaluate data collection approaches in greater detail in�Section 4.2�below.",Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches
81,How can wearable devices and smartphones play a role in capturing individuals' natural behaviors and physical manifestations of mental health-specific symptoms?,"Meanwhile, for physical symptoms, the unobtrusiveness and ubiquity of smartphones and wearable devices have great potential to capture individuals? natural behaviors, which could reflect the physical manifestations of MH-specific symptoms. For example, the association of higher depression severity with lower physical mobility, demonstrated via being stationary for a greater proportion of time or traveling to fewer places sensed using GPS and accelerometer, may suggest depressive symptoms of losing interest in surroundings, lethargy, or social isolation. Wearable sensors could complement by offering sleep-related information like sleep states and duration to infer sleep quality. In addition, individuals? social media activities could reflect their personal routines and behaviors, for example, higher susceptibility to insomnia or sleeping problems implied through frequent posting activities during midnight. In contrast, a decline in social interactions is an example of social symptoms that might indicate a reduction of interest in surroundings. Such social interactions could include both verbal communications detected via microphones in smartphones and social interactions made through social media platforms and social mobile applications. Lastly, wearable devices are the only passive data source capable of tracking changes in physiological symptoms, including heart rate, skin temperature, and calories burnt.",Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches
82,"Can you explain why some researchers found that gender-specific classification models outperformed gender-independent models, while others found that global models trained on all genders were more effective in predicting gender-specific instances?","Meanwhile, existing attempts at gender-based subgroup personalization also highlighted the potential significance of gender in identifying MH disorders. Researchers achieved such personalizations via training the same ML models on gender-specific samples [92,94,219], fine-tuning and building individual ML models for each gender subgroup [48,161], or incorporating gender prediction as an auxiliary task in an MTL approach [70]. Nevertheless, existing researchers found contradicting findings of models constructed from gender-specific samples. For instance, Pampouchidou et al. [48] and Samareh et al. [54] proved that gender-based classification models outperformed gender-independent ones, whereas others [92,94] demonstrated that global models trained on all genders predicted gender-specific evaluation instances more effectively than those trained on gender-specific data. Attempts above [92,219] further uncovered challenges in effectively predicting female samples, where the outcomes indicated that gender-specific models trained and evaluated on female samples perform worse than those of male samples.",Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches
83,"Can you provide more information on the specific studies mentioned that found MFCC features to be more effective in detecting depression, Chinese language audio samples, and bipolar disorders compared to textual embeddings?","On the contrary, several revelations highlighted the great potential of audio MFCC features. For example, a study [65] attempting to detect depression in audio samples of less than 10 seconds, another [72] conducted on Chinese language audio samples, and one on detecting bipolar disorders [103] found MFCC features more effective than textual embeddings. Nevertheless, more fine-grained comparisons are required to justify the efficacy of one modality or modality-specific feature over the other due to the varying influence of experimental contexts and setups in data collection and feature extraction.",Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches
84,"How do the unsupervised techniques mentioned in the studies, such as clustering with K-nearest neighbors and anomaly detection with Isolation Forest, contribute to the development of more effective approaches for analyzing smartphone sensor data in the context of mental health monitoring?","We observed a few studies applying unsupervised techniques, with clustering using K-nearest neighbors being the most common approach. A few other researchers also adopted anomaly detection using existing unsupervised techniques like Isolation Forest (ISOFOR) [166], or statistical measures such as�t-tests for detecting outliers among preliminary prediction outcomes [163]. The research attempts mentioned above revealed that these unsupervised approaches appear more promising on smartphone sensor data than conventional ML approaches, including SVM, RF, GDBT, and MLP. In addition, AbaeiKoupaei et al.?s work [196] was the only semi-supervised learning we identified in this study, in which the authors employed a ladder network classifier [305] consisting of stacked noisy encoder and denoising autoencoder [306]. There were also novel approaches adapting various concepts, including recommender system (RS) [173,307], node classification [173], and federated learning [168]. Additionally, some studies employed computations to learn association parameters [83,189] or deduce prediction outcomes from distance-based homogeneity [85].",Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches
85,"How do ensemble learning algorithms, particularly XGBoost and AdaBoost, demonstrate their effectiveness compared to other traditional models like SVM, RF, K-nearest neighbor, logistic regression, and DNN in the context of mental health applications?","Ensemble learning algorithms have shown remarkable effectiveness by combining base models with similar or complementary learning principles [173]. Similar to supervised learning, such algorithms were applied to univariate inputs, which could be hand-crafted numerical features or predicted outputs (e.g., regression scores, probabilities, binary labels) from other baseline models. The few popular ensemble learning approaches are tree-based, such as random forest (RF) [300], eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), AdaBoost [301], and Gradient Boosted Regression Tree [302], which utilize decision trees as fundamental. XGBoost and AdaBoost were gradually favored by researchers due to their better predictive performance. Specifically, few studies [134,158,184,212] revealed XGBoost as the most effective among SVM, RF, K-nearest neighbor, logistic regression, and DNN models. In contrast, researchers also proposed novel hierarchical ensemble architectures by stacking algorithms (e.g., XGBoost [194], Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) [192]) into layers where models in subsequent layers receive outputs from previous layers as inputs for ensemble predictions. For example, Mishra et al. [185] and Liu et al. [123] adapted the feature-stacking [303] approach by utilizing logistic regression to combine predictions of various first-level learners, like SVM, KNN, and Lasso regression, applied independently to different feature sets. In addition, Tabassum et al. [168] combined an LSTM-based model applied to hourly time series sensor data and an RF on statistical features aggregated across the data collection duration to benefit from the strengths of respective learning algorithms.",Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches
86,"Can you provide more details on how researchers have incorporated attention mechanisms into existing NN architectures like FC layers, LSTM, and GRU to improve effectiveness in capturing contextual information?","The abundance incorporation of LSTM [294] for its capability of capturing temporal information across long sequences emphasized its potential. Transformer-based models [295], such as BERT [266] (including its variants like RoBERTa [296], ALBERT [297], EmoBERTa [298]) and XLNet [285], also gained popularity due to their capability to effectively capture contextual information through positional encodings [129] and attention mechanisms to learn different significance weights of relevant information. In contrast, some researchers incorporated attention mechanisms into existing NN architectures such as FC layers, LSTM, and GRU to achieve such emphasis. Despite demonstrating satisfactory efficacy, existing researchers obtained inconsistent findings regarding the influence of NN architecture complexity on the resulting effectiveness. For example, stacking NN architectures, like GRUs [119], CNNs [60], and LSTM [215], improved performance on top of utilizing baseline architectures such as those on both hand-crafted univariate features and raw signals. However, a few studies proved simple shallow NN-based models to succinctly outperform deeper architectures, for instance, AlexNet outperforming VGG-16 and RestNet101 [122], and a 2-layer Bi-LSTM which outperformed LSTM and GRU of varying layers [220].",Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches
87,Can you explain how neural networks are utilized for supervised learning tasks and what function they aim to approximate in this context?,"A neural network (NN) [290] is fundamentally made up of an input layer, followed by one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each of these layers consists of neurons connected through links associated with weights. An FC layer is included in specific architectures to perform high-level reasoning since it connects all neurons in the previous layer to every neuron in the current layer to generate global semantic information [291]. Meanwhile, an architecture is considered a deep neural network (DNN) when more hidden layers are involved. Although NN architectures could be utilized for various learning approaches, such as supervised, semi-supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning [293], this subsection only concerns those utilized for supervised learning tasks. In such contexts, an NN algorithm approximates a function that maps data received by input neurons to outputs via output neurons by adjusting weights between connected neurons [290]. Therefore, NNs can receive numerical data and yield outputs of any dimension, aligning with the corresponding number of neurons in the input and output layers, respectively.",Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches

91,Can you provide examples of how attention-based architectures and cross-attention mechanisms are used in model-level fusion for multimodal data?,"Unlike feature-level fusion, which concatenates features directly into a single representation, model-level fusion methods utilize an architecture or ML model to learn joint representations that consider the correlation and relationships between feature representations of all modalities. For instance, attention-based architectures (e.g., attention layers, transformers with multi-head attention mechanisms) were adopted to learn shared representations incorporating modality-specific representations with varying extents of contributions based on their significance. Meanwhile, cross-attention mechanisms were employed to consider cross-modality interactions. Shen et al. [20] also proposed using dictionary learning to learn multimodal joint sparse representations, by claiming that such representations are more effective than using features directly as the inputs of ML models. Nevertheless, we acknowledge the limitation that our categorization is merely based on our understanding, and specific fusion techniques in each category may implicitly involve a combination of various fusion levels. For a complete list of studies, methods, and tools, see�Appendix B.",Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches
92,"Can you provide examples of fusion techniques at each of the three main classes - feature, score/decision, and model levels?","Multimodal fusion techniques combine features extracted from different modalities (e.g., audio + visual + textual data) into a single representation for training an ML model. Inspired by an existing work [69], we categorized existing fusion techniques into three main classes, i.e., at the feature, score/decision, and model levels. We hereby emphasize that the current discussion excludes scenarios where fusion is not required if modality-specific features are in independent numerical forms, which ML algorithms could be applied directly.",Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches
93,What specific methods or tools have researchers used to estimate personality scores based on textual content in studies related to the association between mental health symptoms and personality traits?,"On the other hand, existing works [286,287] proved the potential association between MH symptoms and personality traits, where pursuing perfection, ruminant thinking and interpersonal sensitivity could be markers of suicide risk [287], whereas conscientiousness and neuroticism exhibited close relations to depression cues [121]. Researchers have estimated the personality scores of study samples based on textual content, for example, using IBM?s Personality Insights�https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-natural-language-understanding�(accessed on 10 December 2023) [57,121] or computing the proportion of words relevant to those in perfection- and ruminant-thinking-related lexicons [187]. Specifically, Chatterjee et al. [188] uncovered that 56% of suicidal samples demonstrated the association between low agreeableness and high neuroticism scores with increased suicide ideation, compared to most healthy controls with high agreeableness and optimism scores. Another study [130] also found that individuals with depressive symptoms generally have higher neuroticism and lower optimism scores.",Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches
94,"Can you provide more information on how sociability features like the number of incoming/outgoing phone calls and text messages, as well as the duration of phone calls, can be used as indicators of mental health disorders?","Sociability Features: Sociability features, such as the number of incoming/outgoing phone calls and text messages and the duration of phone calls, were also potential indicators of MH disorders [164,175]. For instance, negative MH states are associated with making more phone calls and text messaging [205,222] and reaching out to more new contacts [222]. On the other hand, adult and adolescent populations suffering from MDD were revealed to receive fewer incoming messages [149] and more phone calls [162], respectively. Lastly, ambient environments could also play a role since individuals with schizophrenia were found to be around louder acoustic environments with human voices [206], whereas those with negative MH states demonstrated a higher tendency to be around fewer conversations [205] than healthy controls.",Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches
95,Can you provide more details on how researchers gathered sleep information in relation to physical mobility features and its correlation with depressive symptoms?,"Physical Mobility Features: Studies have shown that negative MH states and greater depression severity are associated with lower levels of physical activity, demonstrated via fewer footsteps, less exercising [154], being stationary for a greater proportion of time [205], and less motion variability [149], whereas a study on the student population showed an opposite trend for increased physical activity [157]. Movements across locations in terms of distance, location variability, significant locations (deduced through location clusters) [177], and time spent in these places [164] were also valuable. For instance, researchers found greater depression severity or negative MH states associated with less distance variance, less normalized location entropy [154,158], lower number of significant visited places with increased average length of stay [158], and fewer visits to new places [205]. In contrast, Kim et al.?s [162] investigation on adolescents with major depressive disorders (MDD) found that they traveled longer distances than healthy controls. Timing and location semantics could further contribute more detailed insights, such as the discoveries of individuals with negative MH states staying stationary more in the morning but less in the evening [205], those with more severe depression spending more time at home [154,175], and schizophrenia patients visiting more places in the morning [206]. Researchers also acquired sleep information either through inferences from a combination of sensor information relating to physical movement, environment, and phone-locked states or through the APIs of sleep inferences in wearable devices. Sleep patterns and regularity were demonstrated to correlate with depressive symptoms [150,158] where individuals with positive MH states wake up earlier [205], whereas MDD patients showed more irregular sleep (inferred from sleep regularity index) [149].",Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches
96,How do researchers utilize social networks to identify mental health disorders and what specific types of public information from social media users are incorporated in the research studies mentioned in the text?,"Several research attempts emphasized the role of social networks in identifying MH disorders, where researchers incorporated public information belonging to other social media users engaged through followings, likes, comments, and tweet replies. For instance, Liaw et al. [134] and Ricard et al. [110] respectively involved liked content and that generated by users who have liked or commented on posts created by individuals of concern. The prior found the amount of depression keywords in liked content to contribute the most performance gain, whereas the latter found an improvement after incorporating such community-generated data. Similarly, Pirayesh et al. [138] and Mihov et al. [139] incorporated content created by homogeneous friends identified through clustering and computation and noticed improvement after increasing the number of homogeneous friends and their respective tweets.",Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches
97,Can you explain how researchers use metadata associated with social media posts to infer social networks and interactions?,"On top of user-generated texts and images on social media platforms, researchers could infer social networks and interactions from metadata associated with users and posts, where followers and followings could indicate ?friendships?, whereas interactions like posting, liking, and commenting could reveal social interactions and topics of interest. While most platforms offer fundamental post information such as time posted, likes, and comments, some details are platform-specific, such as retweets (Twitter), check-in locations (Facebook), favorites (Twitter), profile images (Instagram), and users? details like age and gender (Sina Microblog). Graph architectures could then be adopted to model the information above, for instance, by having a node for each user and an edge between two nodes representing the presence or extent of particular social interactions.",Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches
98,"Can you provide more details on how linguistic features such as the use of first-person pronouns and negative words are specifically linked to mental health conditions like depression and suicidal ideation, as mentioned in the study?","Abundant studies consistently highlighted the prominent correlations between textual features and MH conditions. For example, the significance of linguistic features in MH identification was accentuated by compelling evidence showing that individuals with depression and suicidal intent used more first-person pronouns, possibly reflecting their suppressed nature. This linguistic pattern was observed in textual content across various social media platforms, including Weibo [109,123], Instagram [116], Twitter [25,118,121], and Reddit [186], as well as in transcribed audio recordings [184]. Meanwhile, several other studies [123,187] further found more frequent usage of the word ?others? or third-person pronouns (e.g., ?they?, ?them?, ?he?, ?she?) than healthy controls, which the authors hypothesized as the tendency of depressive or suicidal individuals in acquiring physiological distance and reluctant to show feelings. In addition, researchers found individuals with depression, suicidal intent, and schizophrenia exhibiting a pronounced expression of negative emotions compared to healthy controls. This observation is substantiated by various features, including the frequency of negative words [20,118,123,204,220] and negative emoticons [130,188], as well as negative sentiment scores of overall sentences [121].",Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches
99,How do individuals with mental illness differ in their color preferences on social media compared to healthy controls according to the research studies mentioned in the text?,"Meanwhile, other research studies [25,111,220] revealed that individuals with mental illness and depression post less colorful images of darker and grayer colors on social media compared to healthy controls, who prefer brighter and more vivid colors such as blue and green. These patterns potentially align with existing knowledge [275] regarding the influence of individuals? mood on color preferences, where principal hues (e.g., red, yellow) and intermediate hues (e.g., yellow-red, blue-green) evoked higher positive emotions than achromatic colors like black and white. Specifically, Yazdavar et al. [25] demonstrated a strong positive correlation between self-reported depressive symptoms and individuals? tendency to perceive surroundings as grey or lacking colors. In contrast, Xu et al. [220] further computed pleasure, arousal, and dominance scores from brightness and saturation values. The authors then discovered that individuals with mental illness preferred less saturated images (i.e., containing more grey [276]), which implied higher dominance and arousal than healthy controls.",Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches
100,"Can you provide more information on how facial action units (FAUs) are used to detect depressive symptoms and how specific AUs such as AU12, AU10, and AU25 are correlated with depression?","Facial action units (FAUs) were introduced to describe facial movements [272], where each AU corresponds to contractions of specific facial muscles (e.g., AU5 represents raised upper eyelids, AU6 represents raised cheeks, and AU15 represents pulled-down lip corners [273] as shown in�Figure 3). FAUs have shown significant promise in encoding facial expressions, each constituted by a combination of AUs [273] as shown in�Figure 4. In the current context, Thati et al. [99] demonstrated that a few AUs correlate significantly with depressive symptoms, specifically, AU12, AU10, and AU25, corresponding to pulled lip corners, raised upper lips, and parted lips, respectively. Referring to both�Figure 3�and�Figure 4, this finding could be associated with a smiling expression comprising AU12 and AU25 and low mood as demonstrated by AU10. It could potentially indicate the ?smiling depression? scenario mentioned by Ghosh et al. [132], where individuals with depression may choose to post more happy images compared to healthy controls who expressed diverse emotions.",Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches
101,"Can you explain how specific audio features such as energy contours, kurtosis, skewness, and MFCCs are utilized in identifying individuals with suicidal intent?","Several popular approaches to extract audio features include adopting OpenSmile [267] to extract low-level descriptors (LLDs) and employing pre-trained deep learning (DL) models to extract high-level deep representations from either audio samples directly or transformed spectrogram images [66]. Researchers have identified several audio features to be significant indicators of MH conditions. For instance, Yang et al. [193] discovered histogram-based audio LLDs to be more effective than visual features in identifying bipolar disorder, and such indicators are more prominent in male samples. Meanwhile, from specific features such as energy contours, kurtosis, skewness, voiced tilt, energy entropy, and MFCCs, Belouali et al. [184] demonstrated that individuals with suicidal intent spoke using a less animated voice with flatter energy distribution and fewer bursts. Their speech had less vocal energy and less abrupt changes and were more monotonous. Other audio features found to be significant indicators of depression and PTSD include audio intensity, pitch, and spectral decrease [54,107]. Since it is beyond the scope of the current work to dive deep into audio samples and features, we direct interested researchers to an existing work [268] for greater details on audio processing and features that could be extracted at varying domains (e.g., time, frequency, and cepstrum) [54].",Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches
102,"Can you provide more information on how incorporating clinical opinions, particularly from trained psychiatrists or psychologists, helps enhance the accuracy of ground truth labels in the context of social media data analysis for mental health research?","This ground-truth acquisition method heavily relies on individuals? willingness and openness to share content publicly on social media platforms. Therefore, to enhance the accuracy of ground truth labels, studies incorporated clinical opinions when annotating and labeling social media data. These opinions were sourced from trained psychiatrists or psychologists [112,131,145,186,219], as well as staff and students within the university settings with backgrounds in psychology [142,185]. For example, Abuhassan et al. [218] incorporated opinions from domain experts with specific expertise in eating disorders (EDs), psychology, mental health, and social media. The authors obtained a comprehensive and well-rounded annotation strategy to guide the categorization of social media users into individuals with an explicit diagnosis of EDs, healthcare professionals, communicators (i.e., those who communicate, exchange, and distribute information to the public), and non-ED individuals. The approaches above attempted to address the possibility of researchers overlooking implicit indicators of specific MH disorders or lacking sufficient clinical knowledge to make accurate inferences based on several posts created by each individual [135,189]. However, these efforts may not suffice, given that public content posted by individuals might be adapted with considerations of self-presentation factors.",Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches
103,"How do researchers derive ground truth from the responses collected through mobile applications or devices in clinical and self-reported assessments of mental health using scales like the HDRS, PHQ-9, BDI, and CES-D?","If access to healthcare professionals is unavailable, these scales can be administered through mobile applications or other devices to be answered and self-reported by subjects. Examples of scales used in both clinical and self-reported assessments are the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) [254], Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) [255], Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) [256], and Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) [257]. Researchers can compile and analyze the responses to derive ground truth based on established guidelines. For example, the summation score of the PHQ-9 scale corresponds to depression severity levels, where 5, 10, 15, and 20 represent mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively [258].",Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches
104,Can you provide an example of how the ground truth for data used in supervised learning for mental health disorders is obtained through self-reports by individuals?,"Data used for supervised learning must have a ground truth (i.e., if the person to whom the data belong suffers from a specific MH disorder) so that ML models learn to distinguish data points of different ground-truth labels.

105,What specific measures were taken in existing studies to ensure secure data transmission from wearable devices to internet-connected servers or mobile applications?,"Wearable devices have further enabled the collection of physical activity, movement, sleep, and physiological signals like heart rate (HR), electrodermal activity (EDA), skin temperature (ST), and galvanic skin response (GSR). Some examples of wearables are Empatica E4 wristbands [149,172,178], Microsoft Band 2 [150], Fitbit Charge or Flex trackers [151,155,164,180,181,182,191], and the Galaxy S3 smartwatch [169]. Data gathered through these devices were transmitted directly to an internet-connected server [215] or transferred via Bluetooth [210] to dedicated mobile applications that handle the transmission as described above. As such, existing studies executed similar procedures for obtaining participants? consent before data collection and privacy measures to ensure secure data transmission.",Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches
106,How do researchers use smartphone sensors and mobile applications to collect and analyze data related to mental health disorders and behaviors?,"Smartphone sensors, such as accelerometers, GPS, light sensors, and microphones, could collect and infer information about smartphone usage, physical activity, location, and an individual?s environment. Researchers have adopted existing mobile applications that collect sensing data, such as Purple Robot [232] (Android only), SensusMobile [99] (Android only), and LifeRhythm [233] (Android and iOS), and those with additional features, including Behavidence�https://www.behavidence.com/�(accessed on 10 December 2023) (Android application that displays similarity scores of inferred behaviors to specific MH disorders), Insights [234] (Android application with customizable questionnaires), MoodMirror [235] (Chinese Android application that connects with a wristband via Bluetooth), or BiAffect�https://www.biaffect.com/�(accessed on 10 December 2023) (iOS only), that collect keyboard typing data specifically. In contrast, some researchers developed mobile applications for their use cases using frameworks like AWARE [236] (collects sensor data from Android and iOS devices and supports integration with data analysis pipeline). These mobile applications act as a central management system, either storing data locally in individuals? devices or transmitting them to a central server for processing and analysis.",Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches
107,How do researchers typically select and analyze user-generated content from social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit for studying mental health conditions?,"Meanwhile, social media platforms like Twitter, Reddit, Sina Microblog, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, Flickr, and Blued offer a safe space for information sharing, communication, and expressing emotions. Various forms of user-generated content publicly available on these platforms are texts, images, social interactions (likes, comments, mentions, and shares), and user profile information (followers, followings, bio descriptions, profile images). Researchers could crawl content from these platforms using the provided application programming interface (API) by strategically querying content posted within a predetermined duration for observation, locating the presence of relevant phrases or keywords within textual content, or sourcing directly from discussion space revolving around specific MH conditions where applicable. For instance, Shen et al. [20] identified candidate social media users based on tweets containing the character string ?depress? and utilized such tweets as anchor points to sample remaining tweets posted by the corresponding users within a month relative to anchor tweets. Meanwhile, Mishra et al.

The final quality score would be the summation of the score corresponding to the conformity of the checklist items. Acknowledging that healthy controls are not always necessary in relevant studies, we have specifically included checklist item QC3 due to our interest in the effectiveness of data sources and methodological approaches in distinguishing between individuals with and without MH disorders.

124,"Can you provide more details on the criteria used for evaluating data collection approaches in terms of reliability, verifiable ground truth, cost-effectiveness, and acceptability among the general population?","In this systematic literature review (SLR), we address these limitations by analyzing individual methodological phases in greater detail. We further narrow our scope to studies adopting passive sensing, which gathers users? data non-intrusively via ubiquitous sensors or devices and requires minimal user inputs. This decision is supported by our hypothesis that people?s natural behaviors are best captured when their daily routines are subject to the least possible obstructions [29,30]. Less intrusive approaches have also been shown to have better acceptance among the general population, with the need to carry/wear dedicated equipment being reported as off-putting and causing levels of discomfort [12,31]. From a recent survey [17], we learned that two key motivations for ML applications to mental health are the accessibility to behavioral data enabled by continuous and non-invasive approaches and the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of timely and automated data processing. Drawing inspiration from the survey above, we establish several criteria that we anticipate in data collection approaches that are practical to promote subsequent effective detection of MH disorders: (1) reliability (i.e., ensuring that the data closely represents actual behaviors), (2) verifiable ground truth, (3) cost-effectiveness, and (4) acceptability among the general population. Consequently, we conduct a detailed analysis of each data source based on these criteria. This SLR aims to (1) assess the current trend of multimodal ML approaches for detecting various MH disorders and (2) identify an optimal strategy leveraging passively sensed multimodal data and ML algorithms.

Nevertheless, the dynamic nature of an individual?s health, influenced by factors such as genetics, medical history, and lifestyle, remains a complex and demanding challenge to resolve [18]. Similarly, diagnoses of MH disorders are intricate due to the multifaceted nature of MH, involving emotional (e.g., sadness, helplessness), behavioral (e.g., isolation, self-talk), and physical (e.g., body aches, sleeplessness) aspects [19]. In addition, various perceived causes could contribute to MH issues, encompassing psychological (e.g., low self-esteem, overthinking), socioeconomic (e.g., racial and ethnic discrimination, poverty), and social (e.g., family conflicts, interpersonal relationships) factors [19]. As such, we hypothesize the need for multimodal data, i.e., data with multiple modalities each referring to a form of data or a signal from a data source, to achieve complementary effects for improved detection. For example, an existing work [20] has seen multimodal social media data, consisting of text, images, post metadata (e.g., time posted, likes, comments), and user metadata (e.g., profile description and image, followers), to offer additive effect when information from all modalities are incorporated. Additionally, the reliance of ML systems on extensive data and the heterogeneity of data from various sources necessitates the exploration of scalable and sophisticated ML methodologies to manage and standardize such big data, with considerations of privacy and security to ensure the confidentiality of patients? information [21].",Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches
126,How do mental health disorders impact individuals' daily lives and their ability to carry out tasks at work or participate in activities?,"Mental health (MH) issues are pervasive in modern society, with the World Health Organization estimating that around 1 in 8, or 970 million people, were living with a mental health condition in 2019 [1]. The COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented times, leading to a reported increase in rates of anxiety and major depression by 25% in 2020 [2]. Subsequently, 42.9% of people in Australia aged between 16 and 85 years had experienced a mental disorder at some time in their lives as of 2022 [3], whereas 22.8% of adults in the U.S. were estimated to be experiencing mental illness as of 2021 [4]. With figures estimating that MH disorders will contribute to an economic loss of around USD 16 trillion globally by 2030 [5], it is unsurprising that MH has become a government priority worldwide. Specifically, the Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013?2030 [6] encompasses several global targets to promote improved mental health and well-being, where service coverage for MH conditions will have increased at least by half, and 80% of countries will have integrated mental health into primary health care by 2030. The impacts of MH issues on individuals? lives are enormous. For example, people with mental illness reported having difficulty carrying out daily activities or requiring much energy and focus to meet demands at work [7], whereas those with depression experienced decreased enjoyment of activities and social interactions due to fluctuations in mood states [8]. Anxiety has also been found to reduce productivity and performance due to individuals? attention being excessively directed towards other people?s perceptions [9]. In addition, research further demonstrated that emotional dysregulation introduces susceptibility to physical illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, viral infection, and immunodeficiency [10].",Machine Learning for Multimodal Mental Health Detection: A Systematic Review of Passive Sensing Approaches
127,"How does the validation process for digital mental health evaluation frameworks typically progress from initial development to subsequent validation, and what specific steps are involved in this process?","A key next step in the development of the framework is its systematic validation. The trajectory from initial development to subsequent validation is common in the realm of digital mental health evaluation frameworks. For example, the One Mind PsyberGuide Credibility Rating Scale was first created in 2013 and used for several years before undergoing a thorough update and validation process [27]. Similarly, the Unmind Index was first developed through item generation and face validity screening, followed by exploratory factor analysis [38]. This was later complemented by confirmatory factor analysis, convergent and discriminant validity testing, and reliability assessment [38]. These examples illustrate how evaluation frameworks are often initially developed to meet a critical need, then further refined and validated. Following this established pattern, future work on the framework should involve systematic validation. This process could include determining interrater reliability across AI tools and diverse raters, assessing discriminant and convergent validity with existing measures, and sourcing feedback from various stakeholders, including clinicians, AI developers, and end users.",Describing the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health and Applying It to a Generative AI Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Platform: Tutorial

129,Can you provide more details on how the FAITA-Mental Health framework was developed and how it was applied to evaluate the OCD Coach GenAI tool?,"In this study, we reviewed the evolution of evaluative tools for mental health GenAI platforms, described the newly developed, scorable FAITA-Mental Health, and then systematically applied it to evaluate the clinical soundness, user experience, and ethical considerations of OCD Coach, a mental health GenAI tool widely available through the ChatGPT store. Grounded in both theoretical constructs and empirical application, our analysis illustrates the framework?s utility in assessing whether mental health GenAI interventions adhere to clinical, ethical, and user-centricity standards while addressing the diverse needs of populations. Our findings reveal the potential of GenAI to enhance accessibility to mental health services, particularly for undertreated conditions or underserved populations, if these technologies are designed and deployed with a commitment to fairness, accountability, inclusivity, transparency, and adaptability. That many developers of AI mental health tools are for-profit entities focused on business success raises concerns about potential conflicts between financial and shareholder motives on the one hand and the imperative of user-centered mental health care on the other [13,14], highlighting the vital need for rating systems such as FAITA-Mental Health that can transcend business interests to provide a rigorous and ?patient-first? approach to evaluating mental health GenAI platforms. In many ways, this is just as relevant in other disciplines as well, and the framework may potentially be adapted to assess GenAI tools in medical specialties beyond mental health (eg, the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health-Genetics).",Describing the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health and Applying It to a Generative AI Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Platform: Tutorial
130,Can you provide more examples of evidence-based techniques that AI-driven mental health tools could use to encourage user follow-through with crisis resources?,"This scenario also highlights the challenge of balancing safety with user autonomy in AI-driven mental health tools. Immediate, automated escalation such as directing users to contact emergency services might be a legally safer option but could deter users from disclosing sensitive information out of fear of an overreaction. If a clinician were in the loop, a more nuanced approach might involve obtaining informed consent at the outset to notify them about potential crises. Understanding the user?s history and context, the clinician could exercise professional judgment to determine an appropriate course of action. However, in standalone contexts without clinician involvement, the AI should focus on recommending reputable, hyper localized crisis resources in response to concerning user language and using evidence-based techniques to encourage user follow-through with resources. The AI could personalize its response by tailoring the language, tone, and type of encouragement based on the user?s previous interactions, preferences, and communication style, enhancing the likelihood of engagement. This approach would potentially maintain a balance between optimizing for user safety and preserving autonomy, while acknowledging the current limitations of AI in performing personalized risk assessments.",Describing the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health and Applying It to a Generative AI Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Platform: Tutorial

142,Can you provide more information on how OCD Coach solicited feedback from the user and whether there were specific mechanisms in place for users to provide feedback to the OCD Coach development team?,"After the interaction between Sam and OCD Coach, the program solicited feedback, asking, ?How would you rate this GPT so far?? and prompted the user to choose a rating on a continuum of 1 to 5 stars [32]. However, just as OCD Coach directed Sam to a nonexistent OCD Coach website and app when she inquired about data protection and privacy (see subdomain below), it reiterated the same information when Sam explicitly inquired about how she could provide feedback to or seek support from the OCD Coach development team. Within the OpenAI ChatGPT store platform, OCD Coach added that there may be an external social media account related to OCD Coach (?Many developers maintain active social media profiles. You can reach out via platforms like Twitter Facebook, or Instagram, if they have a presence there? [32]) or support forum or community. However, the authors were not able to verify the existence of such platforms. OCD Coach did attempt to seek some rudimentary feedback from Sam (although it is unclear whether this is an OCD Coach?specific or a more general ChatGPT store feature), but it did not proactively offer mechanisms for Sam to provide feedback to the OCD Coach development team. A user could hypothetically reach out to the developer team, BuildBetter (see Transparency subdomain), via its email address accessible through the Help section on its website, or via its Slack or X accounts. However, the relationship between OCD Coach and BuildBetter is not prominently displayed on its website, and a user dealing with a mental health concern might be reluctant to reach out to a team (BuildBetter) whose presence on buildbetter.ai [34] seems to primarily promote an AI product for enhancing team productivity and revenue (see Transparency section).

143,How does OCD Coach demonstrate a noncustomized response to Sam's request for guidance on developing a fear hierarchy for ERP therapy?,"When Sam asked OCD Coach to guide her through ERP, it presented an impersonal and lengthy expression that did not take into account the obsessional or compulsive content that Sam had shared in her initial complaint. After Sam asked OCD Coach to start coaching her in ERP, it again generated a detailed, rigid response, although this time, it included some content specific to Sam?s initial input, such as identifying and listing triggers (?locking and unlocking doors,? ?rearranging household items until they feel just right?) and developing a fear hierarchy (?rearranging books on a shelf,? ?checking the front lock only once?) [32]. However, it did not seek more input from nor collaborate with Sam to develop and refine the various components of this plan. When Sam explicitly asked if OCD Coach could guide her through personalizing, adapting, or collaborating on developing a fear hierarchy, it was able to respond in a stepwise manner, including helping Sam describe, organize, and rate anxiety associated with the triggers.

However, comprehensive frameworks tailored specifically for mental health AI tools remain scarce, in part due to the recency of the medium. Sharma et al [4] have designed a framework for evaluating an LLM for cognitive restructuring that focuses on 5 considerations: nonmaleficence, beneficence, respect for autonomy, justice, and explicability (providing transparency, seeking informed consent, and soliciting feedback). Furthermore, Stade et al [6] have put forth recommendations for the responsible development of clinical LLMs, focusing on several key components, including evidence-based practices, clinical improvement, risk prevention, interdisciplinary collaboration, and trust and usability. Despite being broad-based, Stade et al?s [6] framework?s operational impact may be constrained by the absence of quantifiable metrics that would facilitate comparisons across tools and by indirectly addressing factors such as user agency, empowerment, and personal data management. While these efforts are valuable, they often lack published standardized metrics for quantitative cross-tool comparisons. For instance, Park et al [23] have described the development of safety evaluation tools for mental health chatbots but have not provided specific quantifiable metrics. Furthermore, their framework does not fully address factors such as equity and inclusivity, comprehensive user agency (including data protection and privacy), and transparency. In addition, initiatives such as the CHAI (Coalition for Health AI) [24] are in progress to establish responsible AI standards in health care; however, these are still evolving.",Describing the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health and Applying It to a Generative AI Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Platform: Tutorial
163,How does the FAITA-Mental Health framework differ from the guidelines established by private companies for evaluating AI in mental health interventions?,"As more patients, clinicians, developers, public health authorities, and other stakeholders navigate this uncharted terrain, the imperative for a robust evaluative framework is becoming more evident. While several private companies have established their own AI guidelines and attempted to align them with ethical standards [7-12], for-profit mental health startups may be too beholden to market forces to be fully attuned to the requirements of health care [13,14]. Thus, there is a need for a broad-based evaluative framework that transcends business interests to help ensure that AI-powered technologies are not just effective but also safe, user-centered, inclusive, and ethically sound. In this paper, we review evaluative approaches used in AI mental health interventions, describe the new Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health (FAITA-Mental Health) and its scoring system, then systematically demonstrate how the framework can be applied to assess a ?real-world? GenAI mental health tool available on the ChatGPT (OpenAI) store.",Describing the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health and Applying It to a Generative AI Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Platform: Tutorial
164,"How does the FAITA-Mental Health scale assess AI mental health platforms, and what key domains does it focus on while grading these platforms?","As artificial intelligence (AI) technologies occupy a bigger role in psychiatric and psychological care and become the object of increased research attention, industry investment, and public scrutiny, tools for evaluating their clinical, ethical, and user-centricity standards have become essential. In this paper, we first review the history of rating systems used to evaluate AI mental health interventions. We then describe the recently introduced Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health (FAITA-Mental Health), whose scoring system allows users to grade AI mental health platforms on key domains, including credibility, user experience, crisis management, user agency, health equity, and transparency. Finally, we demonstrate the use of FAITA-Mental Health scale by systematically applying it to OCD Coach, a generative AI tool readily available on the ChatGPT store and designed to help manage the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The results offer insights into the utility and limitations of FAITA-Mental Health when applied to ?real-world? generative AI platforms in the mental health space, suggesting that the framework effectively identifies key strengths and gaps in AI-driven mental health tools, particularly in areas such as credibility, user experience, and acute crisis management. The results also highlight the need for stringent standards to guide AI integration into mental health care in a manner that is not only effective but also safe and protective of the users? rights and welfare.",Describing the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health and Applying It to a Generative AI Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Platform: Tutorial
165,How can artificial intelligence be utilized to support mental health interventions for adolescents in recognizing and addressing suicidal thinking early on?,"In light of the findings, several crucial policy implications emerge. Foremost, the significant role of sadness and despair as predictors underscores the necessity to prioritize mental health support for adolescents [46]. This prominence not only necessitates immediate interventions but also stresses the vital role of education and awareness initiatives, targeting both risk behaviors and associated mental health ramifications. Early identification of suicidal thinking is paramount [47]. Recognizing these indications enables health care professionals to initiate early intervention strategies. This preemptive approach should include tailored counseling, support group engagements, or intensive therapeutic interventions. This can prevent the progression toward actual suicide attempts, which might be driven by mixed emotions or even an intent just to signal distress [48]. Moreover, there is a pressing need to bolster educational and awareness campaigns concerning suicide. Such campaigns serve to equip adolescents with the tools and knowledge necessary, encouraging them to navigate challenges related to risky behaviors and maintain positive mental health perspectives [49].",Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Suicidal Thinking in Adolescents by Derivation and Validation in 3 Independent Worldwide Cohorts: Algorithm Development and Validation Study
166,Can you provide more information on how the use of self-reported data in the study could potentially introduce biases and affect the performance of the model?,"The limitations of this study should be stated. One primary concern pertains to the use of self-reported data, which exposes our results to potential biases, such as recall and social desirability. While this approach offers insights directly from the participants, such susceptibilities might skew the data and ultimately affect the model?s performance. It is also worth noting that the foundational training data were sourced predominantly from adolescents in South Korea [41,42]. This could amplify specific cultural or racial attributes distinctive to Korean adolescents. Equally important to note is that establishing a direct cause-and-effect relationship between significant risk factors and adolescent suicidal thinking remains elusive. This study, while expansive, does not determine if suicidal thinking is a cause or an effect of other risk factors. Further research is needed to unravel these complex interconnections. The potential for overfitting is another critical limitation to consider. Our comprehensive model, regardless of its use of 10-fold cross-validation, might inadvertently capture anomalies rather than genuine patterns [43]. Furthermore, our method for managing missing data, especially through median imputation, poses the risk of introducing unintended biases, which could impact the model?s performance [44]. Lastly, while predicting suicide attempts rather than suicide ideation may be crucial in suicide-related research, the low prevalence of suicide attempts presents limitations in constructing ML models: thus, we have developed predictive models for suicide ideation. With our predictive model, policy researchers, physicians, and community neighbors can develop individualized prevention strategies for these adolescents.",Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Suicidal Thinking in Adolescents by Derivation and Validation in 3 Independent Worldwide Cohorts: Algorithm Development and Validation Study
167,How do the lack of emotional coping strategies in adolescents contribute to an increased risk of suicidal behavior when faced with intense stressors?,"Furthermore, due to their developmental stage, many adolescents have not yet acquired the necessary emotional coping strategies [37]. When faced with intense stressors without these tools, some may come to view suicide as their only way to escape from increasingly desperate circumstances.",Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Suicidal Thinking in Adolescents by Derivation and Validation in 3 Independent Worldwide Cohorts: Algorithm Development and Validation Study
168,"How do feelings of sadness and despair in adolescents relate to their risk of suicidal thinking, and how does brain development during adolescence play a role in this relationship?","The close relationship between feelings of sadness and despair and suicidal thinking in adolescents can be understood from various perspectives, encompassing biological and environmental factors [32]. During adolescence, the brain undergoes significant development, especially in the prefrontal cortex, which controls impulses and emotions [33]. Persistent sadness can interfere with adolescent brain development, resulting in a perpetual state of negative emotions. This increases their risk of suicidal thinking due to feelings of despair and impulsive actions [34].",Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Suicidal Thinking in Adolescents by Derivation and Validation in 3 Independent Worldwide Cohorts: Algorithm Development and Validation Study
169,"What specific features or variables were included in the machine learning model to predict suicidal thinking in adolescents, and how were they determined to be relevant in the decision-making process?","Based on the results of the ML model, we established a web-based app for policy implementation or health system management to support in their decision-making process for cases involving suicidal thinking prediction use in adolescents [30].

171,How did the researchers account for inconsistencies or missing values in the validation cohorts when developing the model for predicting suicidal thinking in adolescents?,"Both the initial training cohort and the external validation cohorts took into account socioeconomic backgrounds, such as household income and academic achievement, as well as risk behaviors such as alcohol consumption, smoking, and screen time. Additionally, factors that could potentially influence mental health, such as feelings of sadness and despair, were also considered. Inconsistencies or missing values in validation sets were addressed by implementing median imputation from the primary training data.

176,"How were missing values handled in the initial data preprocessing stage for the KYRBS, YRBS, and Ungdata datasets, and how did this affect the sample sizes for analysis in terms of adolescents' mental health outcomes related to suicidal thinking?","Initial data preprocessing involved adjusting the sample sizes after the removal of missing values: KYRBS from 1,145,178 to 566,875, YRBS from 438,566 to 103,874, and Ungdata from 89,077 to 19,574. We analyzed data from adolescents aged between 13 and 18 years who participated in the KYRBS from 2009 to 2021, the YRBS in 2021, and Ungdata from 2017 to 2019. The primary outcome, termed ?current suicidal thinking,? was derived from participants? affirmative responses to the question, ?During the past 12 months, did you ever seriously consider attempting suicide?? This outcome indicated that participants had contemplated serious suicidal thinking at least once in the preceding year. The analysis considered several covariates: region, age, sex, BMI (kg/m2), academic achievement, household income, smoking status, alcoholic consumption, stress status, feelings of sadness and despair, exercise habits, and screen time (Figure S1 in�Multimedia Appendix 1) [17].",Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Suicidal Thinking in Adolescents by Derivation and Validation in 3 Independent Worldwide Cohorts: Algorithm Development and Validation Study

178,"How are suicide clusters defined and what factors contribute to their occurrence, specifically among individuals under 25 years old?","Adolescent suicide stands out as a prominent global public health concern, with its rank as the second leading cause of death among young populations underscoring its severity [1,2] Notably, adolescence is a phase characterized by an amplified suicide risk [3]. Concerningly, some geographic regions are experiencing a surge in suicide clusters, where the instances of suicide exceed the typical levels [4]. Research into these clusters indicates that individuals younger than 25 years are up to 4 times more likely to be affected by suicide [5]. Since suicide is preventable in the early stages, there is a pressing need for action through rigorous mental health strategies and proactive educational interventions [6].",Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Suicidal Thinking in Adolescents by Derivation and Validation in 3 Independent Worldwide Cohorts: Algorithm Development and Validation Study
179,"What specific factors were considered by the XGBoost model as predictors of suicidal thinking, and how did they rank in terms of their impact on predicting suicidal behavior?","When trained on the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey data from South Korea with a 95% CI, the XGBoost model reported an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of 90.06% (95% CI 89.97-90.16), displaying superior performance compared to other models.

181,Can you explain in more detail how the machine learning prediction model was developed and what factors were considered in its optimization process?,"Using a large-scale multicenter patient-based registry cohort, we have successfully developed the machine learning prediction model for delirium in South Korean patients with advanced cancer. Our study revealed that the combination of XGBoost and RF delivered the most optimal performance, a conclusion validated by the results of both k-fold cross-validation and the isolated testing dataset. Additionally, we identified sex was the primary predictor of delirium, followed by history of delirium, chemotherapy, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and living with family. Furthermore, we have made our AI accessible to the public through a dedicated website (http://ai-wm.khu.ac.kr/Delirium/) to provide delirium prediction results for patients with advanced cancer. Although external validation using prospectively collected data may be necessary to further refine and validate the model, we have implemented a web application to gather additional data. Notably, the application does not store any user-entered information at present. However, we have plans to securely store the user-entered information with their consent, facilitating a real-time learning process to enhance the machine learning model.","Machine learning-based model to predict delirium in patients with advanced cancer treated with palliative care: a multicenter, patient-based registry cohort"
182,"Can you provide more information on how the limitations mentioned, such as the heterogeneous datasets and the limited sample size, could potentially impact the generalizability and accuracy of the machine learning model in predicting delirium in patients with advanced cancer?","However, this study had several limitations. Firstly, he datasets were collected from patients admitted to four hospitals and were heterogeneous, potentially limiting the generalizability of the model to the general population. Secondly, delirium assessment tools, diagnostic criteria, observation frequency, and timeframes may differ from those used in clinical trials. Thirdly, machine learning models often benefit from larger datasets, but the sample size of this study was limited. Fourthly, our proposed machine learning model underperformed compared to previous studies predicting delirium across varying patient conditions49,50. Given the limitations of our registry construction project, we did not collect data at various time points. Additional research may be necessary to address this gap. Fifthly, dataset of this study lacks information pertaining to delirium-related medications or disease history. However, we have initiated the establishment of a new prospective cohort to supplement the inadequate input data values. Consequently, we plan to conduct further research to develop more sophisticated machine learning modeling through subsequent studies. Finally, due to the retrospective design of our registry for patients with advanced cancer, it was not feasible to distinguish between different types of delirium (hyperactivity, hypoactivity, and mixed type). We are fully aware of this limitation, and currently, in our newly established prospective cohort, we are making efforts to differentiate between them. To apply machine learning models and achieve external validation, a larger sample size dataset is required. Lastly, an imbalance in the number of patients in each group may limit the performance of the models51,52.","Machine learning-based model to predict delirium in patients with advanced cancer treated with palliative care: a multicenter, patient-based registry cohort"
183,How does the combination model of XGBoost and RF differ from previous studies that have also used machine learning algorithms to predict delirium in patients with advanced cancer?,"Our results, particularly in the combination model of XGBoost and RF, corroborate previously reported risk factors associated with delirium. Earlier research indicated that advanced age, a history of delirium, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and sex were associated with delirium in patients with advanced cancer admitted to the APCU31?34. Male sex was identified as a significant risk factor for neuropsychiatric disorders, potentially due to the protective role of estrogen in individuals with potential cognitive impairments35,36. Males may exhibit more pronounced neuropsychiatric disorders under acute stress, driven by different corticotropin-releasing factor signaling pathways compared with females37. Consistent with prior studies, our findings highlight old age as a significant risk factor for delirium in patients with advanced cancer38?40, with possible contributing factors being atherosclerosis and malnutrition common in older patients40?42. The association of cigarette smoking with delirium is attributed to nicotine withdrawal during hospitalization1. Smokers have been noted to display more severe agitation, characteristic of hyperactive delirium43. Changes in various neurotransmitter systems, including dopamine, opioids, and cholinergic systems, have been implicated in shared hyperactive delirium44. The relationship between chemotherapeutic agents and delirium remains controversial and inconsistent, as reported in single case reports or studies with small populations. Previous studies have suggested that patients who undergo multiple chemotherapy regimens could experience delirium, which may occur in approximately one in 11 adults receiving chemotherapy45,46. Chemotherapeutic agents may penetrate the blood?brain barrier, potentially serving as a risk factor for delirium47,48. Similar to our study, a previous study was conducted to predict delirium in patients with advanced cancer receiving pharmacological intervention through a visually interpretable prediction model9. This study has the advantage of being easy to use with small number of variables, but it is dependent on Delirium Rating Scale Revised-98 and has a limitation in predicting delirium within three days. On the other hand, our study provided a web application with public access with a machine learning model, and could serve as a medical aid for healthcare providers to monitor the delirium in the patients with advanced cancer.","Machine learning-based model to predict delirium in patients with advanced cancer treated with palliative care: a multicenter, patient-based registry cohort"

185,"What specific machine learning techniques were used in the ensemble approach combining XGBoost and RF, and how did this combination improve the classification performance for predicting delirium in patients with advanced cancer?","Table�2�summarizes the fivefold cross validation accuracy comparison of each model and the ensemble machine learning model using the accuracy metrics of sensitivity, specificity, balanced accuracy, and AUROC. In terms of balanced accuracy and AUROC, the three models?RF, XGBoost, and LGB?demonstrated the highest performance compared with the other single models. To further improve classification performance, we adopted an ensemble approach using three single models with higher performance: RF, XGBoost, and LGB. The results revealed that the combination of XGBoost and RF provided the most optimal performance, achieving the following accuracy metrics: 68.83% sensitivity, 70.85% specificity, 69.84% balanced accuracy, and 74.55% AUROC. Subsequently, we performed feature importance analysis using an ensemble model that combines XGBoost and RF. We averaged and normalized the values of feature importance from the two models and ranked each feature. Figure�1�presents the normalized values of ranked feature importance from all 39 features used to predict delirium in patients with advanced cancer. The results indicated that sex (1.00) had the highest importance value and was the primary contributor to predicting delirium, followed by a history of delirium (0.82), chemotherapy during hospitalization (0.81), smoking status (0.73), alcohol consumption (0.67), living with family (0.49), and age (0.47).","Machine learning-based model to predict delirium in patients with advanced cancer treated with palliative care: a multicenter, patient-based registry cohort"

193,"What specific machine learning models have been used to predict the risk of delirium in hospitalized patients, and how do they compare in terms of accuracy and effectiveness in predicting delirium risk?","To date, nurse-administered questionnaires have mainly been used to predict the risk of delirium in hospitalized patients8. However, physicians may find it challenging to conduct daily assessments through questionnaires. Machine learning models have recently been introduced9?14. Machine learning models were previously used to predict delirium among patients after surgery for degenerative spinal disease10, patients admitted to the intensive care unit11, hospitalized patients without cognitive impairment12, patients admitted to the general ward13, and older patients after general surgery14. Furthermore, previous study on predicting delirium was also conducted in patients with advanced cancer receiving pharmacological interventions through machine learning models. However, this study was limited to patients taking antipsychotic medications or trazodone, and no operational criteria for determining the precipitating factors of delirium9. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for these studies ranged from 0.666 to 0.964.","Machine learning-based model to predict delirium in patients with advanced cancer treated with palliative care: a multicenter, patient-based registry cohort"

To achieve this, this study employed machine learning model to predict delirium in patients in palliative care and identified the significant features that influenced the model. A multicenter, patient-based registry cohort study in South Korea between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2020. Delirium was identified by reviewing the medical records based on the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. The study dataset included 165 patients with delirium among 2314 patients with advanced cancer admitted to the acute palliative care unit. Seven machine learning models, including extreme gradient boosting, adaptive boosting, gradient boosting, light gradient boosting, logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest, were evaluated to predict delirium in patients with advanced cancer admitted to the acute palliative care unit. An ensemble approach was adopted to determine the optimal model. For k-fold cross-validation, the combination of extreme gradient boosting and random forest provided the best performance, achieving the following accuracy metrics: 68.83% sensitivity, 70.85% specificity, 69.84% balanced accuracy, and 74.55% area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The performance of the isolated testing dataset was also validated, and the machine learning model was successfully deployed on a public website (http://ai-wm.khu.ac.kr/Delirium/) to provide public access to delirium prediction results in patients with advanced cancer. Furthermore, using feature importance analysis, sex was determined to be the top contributor in predicting delirium, followed by a history of delirium, chemotherapy, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and living with family. Based on a large-scale, multicenter, patient-based registry cohort, a machine learning prediction model for delirium in patients with advanced cancer was developed in South Korea. We believe that this model will assist healthcare providers in treating patients with delirium and advanced cancer.","Machine learning-based model to predict delirium in patients with advanced cancer treated with palliative care: a multicenter, patient-based registry cohort"
195,"How did adolescent involvement in the design and evaluation cycle of digital mental health interventions benefit the acceptability, feasibility, and usefulness of the interventions, as stated in the text?","In this review, adolescent involvement in various stages of the theory-based design and evaluation cycle enhanced the intervention?s acceptability, feasibility, and usefulness. While RCTs of DMHIs remain the gold standard in this field, they are sparse. Researchers have called for repeat trials at larger scales in diverse settings to assess their effectiveness, scalability, and feasibility. Moreover, only some of the tools and instruments used to evaluate the DMHIs were culturally validated in LMIC contexts, making it difficult to establish how the DMHI would benefit adolescents beyond the test settings.",Digital Mental Health Interventions for Adolescents in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Scoping Review
196,Can you explain how the step of independently screening 25% of the titles and abstracts of potential papers helps reduce bias and enhance the credibility and rigor of the review process?,"There are some limitations to the present review; 1 reviewer performed the database searches, which may have introduced reviewer bias. However, 2 more reviewers independently screened 25% (220/880) of each of the titles and abstracts of potential papers against the eligibility criteria. This step reduces bias and adds credibility and rigor to the review process. In addition, the quality of included studies was not appraised or assessed for risk of bias therefore, there is no assurance of the quality of the evidence in this scoping review. This is consistent with the aim of a scoping review, which is to rapidly map the available literature and not perform a systematic analysis. Finally, the review was limited to papers published in English. This may have significantly reduced the number of eligible studies from LMICs.",Digital Mental Health Interventions for Adolescents in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Scoping Review
197,How do culturally sensitive DMHIs that embed local cultural and religious values by design help to facilitate discussions about stigmatized mental health issues among adolescents?,"Adolescents highlighted some facilitators, such as access to a safe space to discuss stigmatized mental health issues, culturally sensitive DMHIs that embed the local cultural and religious values by design, DMHIs that maintain face-to-face contact while offering therapist-led or lay or peer-led options, access to reading materials in addition to the DMHI, appropriate content that is entertaining, personalized, and has gamified elements, privacy and confidentiality, and DMHIs that are free to use. Previous studies have suggested that addressing the digital divide could mitigate these barriers, providing equitable access to DMHIs, yet care must be taken to ensure that the pursuit of DMHIs does not widen the existing inequalities, further reinforcing the digital divide, undermining the equitable delivery of care [120-122].",Digital Mental Health Interventions for Adolescents in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Scoping Review
198,How do societal attitudes and the digital divide intersect to create barriers to engagement with DMHIs for individuals facing stigma around mental health?,"Stigma (self-stigma, eg, individual level, and societal stigma, eg, system level) remains a complex and multifaceted barrier despite the potential for increased privacy, confidentiality, anonymity, and accessibility through DMHIs [113-115]. Multiple factors contribute to persistent stigma, such as societal attitudes, the digital divide, lack of awareness, fear of exposure, discrimination, and cultural sensitivities [113,116,117]. These factors could limit engagement with DMHIs due to the negative social consequences in areas where mental health is a stigmatized issue [118,119].",Digital Mental Health Interventions for Adolescents in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Scoping Review
199,How did incorporating national or international guidance impact the intervention design and evaluation process in the studies mentioned?,"Further, incorporating national or international guidance enhanced the intervention design, development, and evaluation. For example, 1 study [69] used the WHO guidelines on monitoring and evaluating DHIs, which addressed digital maturity, readiness, and scalability, whereas another [73] consulted the UK Medical Research Council guidance for developing and evaluating complex interventions focused on process evaluation and contextual factors. Finally, 1 study [77] accessed the WHO?s Mental Health Gap Action Programme-Intervention Guide, which considers training requirements and treatment protocols in low-resource settings.",Digital Mental Health Interventions for Adolescents in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Scoping Review
200,"How can participatory approaches aid in improving digital mental health interventions, and what specific activities have been utilized to enhance the design and evaluation of these interventions?","Collectively these studies show that participatory approaches are invaluable for generating insights for improving the DMHIs. Nevertheless, there are challenges [105], and authors are calling for the evaluation of co-design processes in diverse contexts and how that impacts technology [102,103] with clear guidance around these processes [98]. These insights will advance understanding of how and why adolescents engage in DHIs [101] and the health care outcomes of such engagements. From the review, reported activities included feasibility, acceptability, and usability studies, workshops, interviews, and focus groups. All were used clearly and meaningfully to advance the DMHI design and evaluation [24,69,70,73,74].",Digital Mental Health Interventions for Adolescents in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Scoping Review
201,"How did the inclusion of lay, peer, or therapist support contribute to the effectiveness of interventions among adolescents, as compared to self-guided or automized interventions?","An important design element was the inclusion of lay, peer, or therapist support, with adolescents preferring this option [73,76,79]. The benefits of this approach have been previously reported [55,57,97], where interventions with in-person options were more effective than self-guided or automized interventions [55].",Digital Mental Health Interventions for Adolescents in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Scoping Review
202,"How do the findings from the RCTs evaluating the effectiveness of adolescent DMHIs in different countries compare in terms of feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness in reducing symptoms of depression?","While RCTs remain the gold standard for evaluating the effectiveness of DHIs [89,90], they are costly and time-consuming. We identified only 5 RCTs evaluating the effectiveness of adolescent DMHIs [23,56,82,84], with a further 3 RCT protocols underway [74,75,77]. In India, Smartteen [84] was trialed on 21 adolescents with depression against a treatment-as-usual group. The DMHI was feasible, acceptable, and more effective than the treatment-as-usual at reducing symptoms at 12 weeks. Even with reduced therapist time, adolescents adhered to treatment compliance. However, the authors call for more rigorous evaluations at scale. In another study [82], DIALOG+ was adapted for adolescents in educational settings (DIALOG+S), using focus groups with teachers and adolescents. The DMHI was trialed with 70 Colombian adolescents, randomly assigned into DIALOG+S or an active control group (counseling as usual). The intervention was feasible and acceptable and could improve mental health, quality of life, and emotional symptoms. The authors call for larger studies to assess its efficacy. In Iran, the DAD (Dorehye Amozeshie Dokhtaran) [23] was trialed with 128 adolescents, randomly assigned into the DAD or a control group. The intervention showed an improvement in depression symptoms. However, the effects decreased after 12 weeks. The intervention did not affect the outcome expectations or self-efficacy. Elsewhere Shamiri-Digital [75] was trialed with 103 adolescents, randomly assigned into Shamiri-Digital or a study-skills control condition. Shamiri-Digital reduced depressive symptoms compared to the control. However, there were no significant effects on anxiety symptoms, well-being, or happiness. The authors called for replicate trials with extended follow-up periods. In a secondary analysis of this trial, the authors sought to evaluate the costs and cost-effectiveness of Shamiri-Digital through an economic evaluation [91]. Their findings indicate that Shamiri-Digital can be delivered for less than US $4 per student, which is more cost-effective than traditional interventions, for example, 12-16-week cognitive behavioral therapy sessions. However, it is difficult to draw inferences from these studies without critically assessing the quality of the evidence.",Digital Mental Health Interventions for Adolescents in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Scoping Review
203,Can you provide more information about the specific outcome measures used in the studies to assess the feasibility and acceptability of digital mental health interventions among adolescents?,"The study designs included RCTs, mixed methods, and qualitative studies. Most studies reported positive outcomes for symptom reduction, feasibility, and acceptability, measured by specific outcome measures. However, most were small scale and not trialed on a large scale over extended periods. While DMHIs were feasible and acceptable among adolescents, there remains a gap in the literature about their long-term cost- and clinical effectiveness.",Digital Mental Health Interventions for Adolescents in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Scoping Review
204,What specific frameworks or theories were applied in the design and evaluation of DMHIs for adolescents in LMICs as discussed in the scoping review?,"This scoping review aimed to explore what is known about DMHIs for adolescents in LMICs, as reported in the literature. In 2024, the World Bank categorized 134 countries as LMICs [9]. This review located only 11 countries engaged with adolescent DMHIs, illustrating the limited implementation of these solutions across LMICs and reflecting the emergent nature of the field [45]. We analyzed 20 papers to understand how these DMHIs were designed and evaluated, in what capacity adolescents were involved in the design process, what frameworks or theories were applied, and what factors impacted adolescent engagement with the DMHIs.",Digital Mental Health Interventions for Adolescents in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Scoping Review
205,How did the studies in the text incorporate frameworks or theories related to behavior change interventions in their digital mental health interventions?,"Of 20 studies, 60% (n=12) engaged with frameworks, toolkits, models, or theories related to behavior change interventions. These included cognitive behavioral models, social learning theory, theories of coping during adolescence, persuasive systems design, and stress-coping theory, among others. Further, 1 (5%) study consulted a digital health framework that included digital maturity and readiness content [69]. Another study referred to guidance for developing and evaluating complex interventions [73]. One paper (5%) reported how their intervention aligned with the national mental health program and the government?s national adolescent health program [77], ensuring their DMHI meets the needs and priorities of the nation?s adolescents.",Digital Mental Health Interventions for Adolescents in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Scoping Review

224,Can you explain more about how scoping reviews can help in identifying research gaps and informing future studies in the field of digital mental health interventions for adolescents in low- and middle-income countries?,"This scoping review followed the Joanna Briggs Institute Scoping Review Methodology [60] and is reported based on the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines [61]. The PRISMA-ScR checklist is shown in�Multimedia Appendix 1. Scoping reviews are ideal for disciplines with emerging evidence, for example, DMHIs for adolescents in LMICs, where the limited availability of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) hinders researchers from performing systematic reviews and assessing the quality of evidence [62]. Consistent with the purpose of scoping studies, this review does not seek to assess or appraise the quality and robustness of the evidence, nor does it generalize the findings [61,63,64]. By systematically mapping the available literature, a scoping review can highlight the current state of knowledge, identify research gaps, and potentially reveal patterns or trends that can inform future studies [60].

227,Can you provide examples of specific digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) designed for adolescents in LMICs that have been highlighted in the literature during the review period of 2019-2024?,"We selected the review period 2019-2024 for 3 distinct reasons; first, in 2020, the WHO launched its first guidance on designing DHIs with and for young people, recognizing the significance of youth-centered DHIs and considering their specific needs [58]. Second, that same year, the WHO?UNICEF?Lancet Commission called for a renewed focus on the SDGs for advancing child and adolescent health, including mental health, prioritizing young people in the urgent call to action [5]. Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted adolescent mental health worldwide, leading to an increased interest and investment in the delivery of quality, person-centered, remote mental health care [59]. The post?COVID-19 era has provided an opportunity to explore which DMHIs exist for adolescents in LMICs, how they are designed and evaluated, how adolescents are involved in design activities, which theories or models were consulted, and which factors affect adolescent engagement.

229,How do digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) differ in terms of delivery methods and support mechanisms for clients in high-income versus low-income settings?,"The WHO defines DHIs as a discrete functionality of digital technology that is applied to achieve health objectives [20]. In this regard, digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) can be understood as a discrete functionality of digital technology that is applied to achieve mental health objectives. DHIs are classified into 4 overarching groups based on the primary user, for instance, clients (service users), health care providers (health service delivery), health system managers (administration and oversight of public health systems), and data services (data collection, management, use, and exchange) [20]. For clients, DHIs/DMHIs can be delivered at an individual or population level; in high and low-income settings; and via several devices, for example, mobile apps, websites, wearables, and smart devices. Such interventions may be self-guided [21] or delivered with lay support, for instance, from teachers [22] or trained psychologists [23]. Furthermore, some DMHIs include theories of behavior change, such as the self-determination theory [24] or the Social Cognitive Theory [23]. Indeed, research suggests that interventions grounded in behavioral theory are more likely to be effective [25,26].",Digital Mental Health Interventions for Adolescents in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Scoping Review
230,"How do mental health conditions disproportionately affect adolescents in low- and middle-income countries, and what are some of the barriers that prevent them from accessing treatment?","The onset of mental health disorders typically occurs during adolescence (between the ages of 10-19 years), an important time for developing social and emotional skills [6,7]. It is here where adolescents form coping strategies that enable mental health. Equally, it is a time when young people become vulnerable to risk-taking behaviors, for example, substance abuse. Indeed, suicide is the leading cause of adolescent death [6]. Worldwide, 13% of the world?s adolescents (aged 10-19 years) live with a mental disorder [8]; however, widening treatment gaps mean many conditions remain undiagnosed and untreated [6]. Moreover, mental health conditions disproportionately affect adolescents in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) [1]. LMIC economies are those in which the 2022 gross national income per capita was less than US $13,845 [9]. Approximately 90% of the world?s 1.2 billion adolescents reside in LMICs [8]. This population is more vulnerable to human rights violations, and where limited mental health services are available, stigma, discrimination, and social, cultural, and economic challenges are major barriers to treatment access [6,8,10].",Digital Mental Health Interventions for Adolescents in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Scoping Review
231,"How does the United Nations General Assembly's focus on universal health coverage (UHC) contribute to achieving mental health for all, particularly in the context of adolescents?","The World Health Organization (WHO) defines mental health as ?a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, to realize their abilities, to learn well and work well, and to contribute to their communities. Mental health is an integral component of health and well-being and is more than the absence of mental disorder? [1]. The United Nations General Assembly has underscored the key role of universal health coverage (UHC)?where everyone can access the health services they need without financial hardship?in achieving health for all [1]. Indeed, UHC is central to the health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), namely target 3.4: ?by 2030, reduce by one-third premature mortality from noncommunicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being? [1].

237,Can you explain in more detail how the SuStaIn algorithm works and how it is applied to schizophrenia in this study?,"To uncover diverse patterns of pathophysiological progression from cross-sectional only MRI data and cluster individuals into groups (subtypes), we employed a machine learning approach?Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn)19. The methodology of SuStaIn has been described in detail previously19. We also describe the applicability of SuStaIn algorithm to schizophrenia in Supplementary Materials. Here, we briefly describe the main parameter choices specific to the current study. The SuStaIn model requires an�M???N�matrix as input. M represents the number of cases (M?=?4222).�N�is the number of biomarkers (N?=?17). 17 gray matter biomarkers were previously used for SuStaIn modeling in schizophrenia22. Here, all of the AAL3 regions of whole brain were separated and merged into 17 regions of interest (ROIs)22, including frontal lobe, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, insula, cingulate, sensorimotor, Broca?s area, cerebellum, hippocampus, parahippocampus, amygdala, caudate, putamen, pallidum, accumbens and thalamus (Supplementary Table�7). We further examine the relationship between regional volume and illness duration in patients with schizophrenia using the Spearman correlation test (Supplementary Fig.�7). To keep consistent with our previous study22, we used the z-score thresholds (z?=?1, 2, 3) as ?waypoints? of severity in the SuStaIn model. The maximum�z-score in the SuStaIn algorithm was defined at�z?=?5 according to maximum z-score for each biomarker (Supplementary Table�8). We also performed a replication analysis with a reduced maximum z-score (z?=?4) (Supplementary Fig.�8). We then ran the SuStaIn algorithm with 25 start points and 100,000 Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) iterations19�to estimate the most likely sequence that describes spatiotemporal pattern of pathophysiological progression (i.e., ?trajectory?).",Neurostructural subgroup in 4291 individuals with schizophrenia identified using the subtype and stage inference algorithm

In addition, phenotypic characteristics were further quantified in three dimensions, such as cognitive (total score of P2, N5, G5, G10, G11), depression/anxiety (total score of G1, G2, G3, G6, G15) and excitement (total score of P4, P7, G44, G14) via a five-factor model of schizophrenia68.",Neurostructural subgroup in 4291 individuals with schizophrenia identified using the subtype and stage inference algorithm
240,Can you explain how the identified neurostructural schizophrenia subtypes may contribute to a more personalized approach to treatment and care for individuals with schizophrenia?,"In summary, our study reveals two distinct neurostructural schizophrenia subtypes based on patterns of pathological progression of gray matter loss. We extend the reproducibility and generalizability of these brain imaging-based subtypes across illness stages, medication treatments and different sample locations worldwide, independent of macroeconomic and ethnic factors that differed across these sites. The identified subtypes exhibit distinct signatures of neuroanatomical pathology and psychotic symptomatic trajectories, highlighting the heterogeneity of the neurobiological changes associated with disease progress. This imaging-based taxonomy shows potential for the identification of homogeneous subsamples of individuals with shared neurobiological characteristics. This may be a first crucial step in the transition from only syndrome-based to both syndrome- and biology-based identification of mental disorder subtypes in the near future.",Neurostructural subgroup in 4291 individuals with schizophrenia identified using the subtype and stage inference algorithm
241,"What potential therapeutic implications could advancements in AI have on targeting specific brain regions associated with subtype-specific symptomatic trajectories in individuals with schizophrenia, as mentioned in the text?","The two identified subtypes may have several potential therapeutic implications. While the underlying mechanisms associated with a subtype-specific symptomatic trajectory remain unclear, our research shows divergent long-term clinical outcomes between the two neurostructural subtypes. As the disease advanced, for subtype 1, the negative and depression/anxiety symptoms gradually worsened; for subtype 2 these symptoms remained stable. In addition, subtype�1 experienced worse positive symptoms than subtype 2 at the late stage of disease (i.e., duration > 10 years). This is consistent with a prior study that reported greater gray matter reduction in frontal regions in treatment-resistant compared with treatment-responsive individuals with schizophrenia53. Another intriguing aspect is that our prior research on treatment-resistant schizophrenia demonstrated that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) can substantially enhance the volume of the hippocampus and insula; this is also associated with psychotic symptom alleviation54?56. Notably, these two brain regions were also identified as the ?origins? of gray matter loss separately in each subtype. This observation raises the possibility of exploring neuromodulation interventions, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), to target these specific brain regions.",Neurostructural subgroup in 4291 individuals with schizophrenia identified using the subtype and stage inference algorithm
242,How do the gray matter deficits in the Broca's area/fronto-insular cortex and hippocampus in individuals with schizophrenia relate to potential advancements in AI for the diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders?,"The Broca?s area/fronto-insular cortex and hippocampus are identified separately in subtype 1 and subtype 2 as the first regions to show gray matter deficits. This is consistent with our prior finding based on individuals with schizophrenia primarily collected from the Chinese population22. Furthermore, the current study replicates the same two primary regions in a medication-na�ve and a first-episode cohort, suggesting that these neuropathological changes are a reflection of the disease process, rather than medication effects. Broca?s area and the fronto-insular cortex have been extensively implicated in schizophrenia35, supporting Crow?s linguistic primacy hypothesis36�and a triple-network model of the disorder37. Abnormalities in Broca?s area and related regions have been linked with hallucinations in schizophrenia38,39. The early involvement of Broca?s area in the pathology could be related to the presence of these core symptoms of schizophrenia. Moreover, in individuals with psychosis, reductions in the inferior frontal cortex preceding the initial psychotic episode have been reported40,41. A prior study reported reduced dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex in patients with schizophrenia42. In relation to hippocampal pathology, research has emphasized the hippocampus as one of the initial regions to display volumetric loss in schizophrenia25,43. The hippocampus is thought to be involved in potential glutamatergic dysfunction in schizophrenia3. Decreased levels of the NMDA co-agonist D-serine were linked to neurobiological alterations similar to those seen in schizophrenia, including hippocampal volume loss44. Gray matter loss in schizophrenia is associated with medication, stress, drug use and inactivity45,46. In addition, schizophrenia is related to dopaminergic dysregulation, disturbed glutamatergic neurotransmission and increased proinflammatory status of the brain45. The causal interrelationships between these processes and gray matter loss are still unclear. These findings offer evidence regarding the specific neuroanatomical locations where gray matter loss is observed in the schizophrenia subtypes. These two potential origins could also offer a viewpoint on the pathological ?spread? of the disorder.",Neurostructural subgroup in 4291 individuals with schizophrenia identified using the subtype and stage inference algorithm
243,"What specific machine learning algorithm was used in the study to analyze the brain MRI data from individuals with schizophrenia, and how was it able to identify the two distinct neurostructural subtypes?","Our study, applying a machine learning algorithm to brain MRI data from over 4000 individuals with schizophrenia, has revealed two distinct neurostructural subtypes based on patterns of neuro-pathological progression. These subtypes are reproducible and generalizable across different subsamples and illness stages, independent of macroeconomic and ethnic factors that differed across collection locations. Specific patterns of neuroanatomical pathology for each subtype were uncovered. Subtype 1 is characterized by early cortical-predominant loss that first occurs in the Broca?s area/fronto-insular cortex, and shows adverse signatures in cortical morphology and an enlarged striatum. In contrast, subtype 2 is marked by early subcortical-predominant loss that first appears in the hippocampus, and displays significant volume loss in subcortical regions, including the hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, brain stem and striatum. Additionally, we observed distinct trajectories of specific symptoms clusters in these two subtypes: as disease progresses, subtype 1 exhibited a gradual worsening of negative and depression/anxiety symptoms, and less of a decline in positive symptoms compared to subtype 2.",Neurostructural subgroup in 4291 individuals with schizophrenia identified using the subtype and stage inference algorithm
244,"Can you provide more detail on how the distinct trajectories of psychotic symptoms differ between subtype 1 and subtype 2 as the disease progresses through the early, middle, and late stages?","A total of 2622 (62.1%) individuals with schizophrenia were assigned to subtype 1 and the remaining 1600 patients (37.9%) were assigned to subtype 2. The two subtypes exhibit no significant difference in the age, sex, illness duration or PANSS scores (Table�1). To further characterize the psychotic symptomatic trajectory as the disease progresses for each subtype, we further defined three subgroups according to illness duration (early stage [<2 years],�n?=?926; middle stage [2?10 years],�n?=?578; late stage [>10 years],�n?=?682). The results suggested distinct trajectories of psychotic symptoms between the two subtypes (Fig.�4�and Table�3). Specifically, lower positive symptom severity was observed in late stage patients compared early stage patients in both subtypes (subtype 1,�F?=?37.4,�p?=?1.60e???16; subtype2,�F?=?41.9,�p?=?4.68e???18). With the increase of the disease course, subtype 1 showed a gradual worsening of negative symptoms (F?=?4.6,�p?=?9.98e???3), whereas the negative symptoms of subtype 2 remained stable across the three stages of the disease course (F?=?0.1,�p?=?0.884). Additionally, a gradual worsening of depression/anxiety was only observed in subtype 1 (F?=?5.9,�p?=?2.86e???3). Inter-subtype comparisons showed that at the late stage (illness duration>10 years), subtype 1 exhibited worse positive symptoms (t?=?2.9,�p?=?0.003), general psychopathology (t?=?2.5,�p?=?0.010) and worse depression/anxiety (t?=?2.1,�p?=?0.033) compared to subtype 2, after regressing out the effects of age, sex and SuStaIn stage.",Neurostructural subgroup in 4291 individuals with schizophrenia identified using the subtype and stage inference algorithm
245,How were the regional morphological measures used to identify subtype-specific neuroanatomical signatures in individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls?,"To characterize subtype-specific neuroanatomical signatures, we assessed regional morphological measures using FreeSurfer in a subsample including 1840 individuals with schizophrenia and 1780 healthy controls. A total of 330 regional morphological measures in cortical thickness, cortical surface area, cortical volume, subcortical volume and subregion segmentation were quantified (see ?Methods?).",Neurostructural subgroup in 4291 individuals with schizophrenia identified using the subtype and stage inference algorithm
246,Can you provide more detail on how the trajectories of pathophysiological progression in schizophrenia were determined and how the classification patterns were found to be independent of macro-environmental or ethnogenetic factors?,"To examine whether the ?trajectories? were reproducible for samples from different parts of the world, we divided all samples into several sub-cohorts based on where the samples were obtained. Here, samples from China, Japan, South Korea and Singapore were classified into the East Asian ancestry (EAS) cohort. Samples from Europe, the United States, Canada and Australia were classified into the European ancestry (EUR) cohorts (Supplementary Table�4). In addition, Chinese, Japanese, European and North American cohorts were further classified by their site locations in terms of geographic distribution (Supplementary Table�4). Such a division was based on the similar ethnic or environmental factors for each country, region, or continent and the size of subsample, which need to be sufficient to conduct a reliable inference of the SuStaIn trajectory. We found that two ?trajectories? (the optimal number was also�K?=?2, which separately re-estimated in each cohort)?with Broca?s area leading and the hippocampus leading?were also repeated in EAS (Fig.�2a) and EUR (Fig.�2b) cohorts. In addition, the spatiotemporal pattern of each ?trajectory? showed strong, significant correlations between the EAS and EUR cohorts (?trajectory? 1,�r?=?0.948,�p?<?0.001; ?trajectory? 2,�r?=?0.842,�p?<?0.001; Spearman correlation test). This high level of similarity in the trajectories was also observed between cohorts from other locations (Fig.�2c). This suggests that the two biotypes with distinct ?trajectories? of pathophysiological progression in schizophrenia are robust, and their classification patterns are independent of macro-environmental or ethnogenetic factors.",Neurostructural subgroup in 4291 individuals with schizophrenia identified using the subtype and stage inference algorithm
247,"I am interested in understanding how the use of AI in analyzing brain imaging data, as described in the text, can potentially impact the diagnosis and treatment of mental health conditions like schizophrenia. Can you elaborate on how the identification of distinct neuropathological pathways through AI analysis could lead to personalized treatment approaches for individuals with schizophrenia?","Region of interest (ROI)-wise gray matter volume (GMV) z-scores, at each stage of the ?trajectory? for each subtype, show the sequence of regional volume loss across the 17 brain regions for each ?trajectory? (Fig.�1c). To visualize the spatiotemporal pattern of each ?trajectory?, z-score whole brain images were mapped to a glass brain template (Fig.�1d). These maps show a progressive pattern of spatial expansion along with later ?temporal? stages of pathological progression distinct for each ?trajectory? (Supplementary Movie�1�and�2). Specifically, ?trajectory? 1 displayed an ?early cortical-predominant loss? biotype. It was characterized by an initial reduction in Broca?s area, followed by adjacent fronto-insular regions, then extending to the rest of the neocortex, and finally to the subcortex (Fig.�1d). Conversely, ?trajectory? 2 exhibited an ?early subcortical-predominant loss? biotype where volume loss began in the hippocampus, spread to the amygdala and parahippocampus, and then extended to the accumbens and caudate before affecting the cerebral cortex (Fig.�1d). The two ?trajectories? were highly consistent with our previous findings in a predominantly Chinese schizophrenia cohort22. We also re-estimated trajectories based on a validation dataset (N?=?3120) that has removed the original data used in our previous SuStaIn study22. In the validation dataset, we replicated the two ?trajectories? that begin in either the Broca?s area or the hippocampus (Supplementary Fig.�1). We also observed a high similarity of ?trajectory? spatiotemporal pattern between the original dataset and the additional dataset (?trajectory? 1,�r?=?0.879,�p?<?0.001; ?trajectory? 2,�r?=?0.631,�p?<?0.001; Spearman correlation test). The phenotypic subtypes, based on the different pathophysiological ?trajectories?, are thus replicated in a large cross-geography sample, confirming the presence of two different neuropathological pathways with different anatomical origins in schizophrenia22.",Neurostructural subgroup in 4291 individuals with schizophrenia identified using the subtype and stage inference algorithm
248,"How could the development of a taxonomy of subtypes in schizophrenia using only anatomical MRI scans potentially impact the diagnosis and treatment of other complex neuropsychiatric disorders like major depressive disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder?","Together, these analyzes aim to create an easily accessible (with a single anatomical MRI), interpretable (based on ?progressive? pathology) and robustly generalizable (across ethnic, sex and language differences) taxonomy of subtypes that share common neurobiological mechanisms in schizophrenia. If proven effective, other complex neuropsychiatric disorders with high heterogeneity26,27, such as major depressive disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, could also benefit from such a subtyping paradigm. This has the potential to transition the field of psychiatry from syndrome-based to both syndrome- and biology-based stratifications of mental disorders.",Neurostructural subgroup in 4291 individuals with schizophrenia identified using the subtype and stage inference algorithm
249,How does the Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) method utilize cross-sectional MRI data to identify clusters of individuals with common trajectories of disease progression in brain disorders?,"Artificial intelligence methods such as machine learning can be applied to brain imaging11�to categorize individuals based on their profiles of brain metrics, and holds the potential for revealing the underlying neurobiological mechanisms associated with disorder subtypes12. Machine learning algorithms are increasingly used to subtype brain disorders13?16. Prior studies have primarily focused on grouping individuals into distinct categories without considering disease progression17,18. A major obstacle to identifying distinct patterns of neuro-pathophysiological progression (referred to as progression subtypes) stems from the lack of sufficient longitudinal data covering the lifespan of the disorder. Recently, a data-driven machine learning approach known as Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) was introduced19. SuStaIn uses a large number of cross-sectional observations, derived from single time-point MRI scans, to identify clusters (subtypes) of individuals with common trajectory of disease progression (i.e., the sequence of MRI abnormalities across different brain regions) in brain disorders20?23. It should be noted that SuStaIn estimates the pseudo-longitudinal sequence (i.e., SuStaIn trajectory) based on only cross-sectional data. Therefore, the fitted SuStaIn trajectories do not directly reflect the actual pathophysiological progression of the illness. By applying SuStaIn to MRI data from individuals with schizophrenia, primarily collected from the Chinese population, we found that the progression of gray matter loss in schizophrenia can be better characterized through two distinct phenotypes: one characterized by a cortical-predominant progression, originating in the Broca?s area/fronto-insular cortex, and another marked by a subcortical-predominant progression, starting in the hippocampus22. Such brain-based taxonomies may reflect neurostructural subtypes with shared pathophysiological foundations, with relevance for neurobiological classification22. However, the generalizability of the two neurostructural subtypes to diverse populations outside of China, and external validation of the subgrouping is required before applying this knowledge to stratify clinical trials.",Neurostructural subgroup in 4291 individuals with schizophrenia identified using the subtype and stage inference algorithm

254,How did the performance of the LLM compare to that of a single human reviewer during the screening phase of the review process?,"Our review method proved to be sensitive at detecting relevant citations and fetched our previous work on suicide, self-harm, opioid addiction, and other topics [42-50]. LLM performance in this review surpassed the performance of a single human reviewer during the screening phase, as evident from the screening benchmarks. Reviews conducted by more than one individual human could reduce selection bias but would require significant additional research effort. Based on the estimation methodology provided by Haddaway and Westgate [51], we estimate this effort to be approximately 3500 person-hours (ie, close to a year of work for two reviewers) to conduct a review of such scope. In addition, the LLM method allowed for the inclusion of non-English papers, as LLMs are multilingual, potentially reducing the language bias; however, the performance of OpenAI GPT can vary depending on the language and the task [52], and we did not benchmark the LLM performance in other languages.",Natural Language Processing and Social Determinants of Health in Mental Health Research: AI-Assisted Scoping Review

In addition, a manual review of LLM outputs (see�Multimedia Appendix 3�for benchmark) revealed that the demographic variables category had a high rate of false positivity, which suggests that gender and age were actually used even less frequently than our numbers indicate.

256,"How do demographic variables, such as age and marital status, intersect with social determinants of health (SDOH) in relation to mental health outcomes?","As for SDOH and demographic variables, there is considerable overlap between the two in the extracted data. Previous work suggests that demographic variables should be part of SDOH; for example, the commonly used variable marital status reflects the social connections, stage of life, and other important social implications for individuals? health [33]. The same can be said about age, the most frequently reported demographic variable. Research has shown that disparities in mental health outcomes persist across different age groups and are often linked to social stress, discrimination, and stigma [34]. These disparities can be exacerbated by obstacles to health care access based on factors such as ethnicity, sex, and occupation [35].",Natural Language Processing and Social Determinants of Health in Mental Health Research: AI-Assisted Scoping Review

The United States has a significant concentration of funding and resources dedicated to mental health research, which is not as prevalent in low- and middle-income countries with financial constraints and inequities in health care resources [24,25]. The disproportionate share of high-income countries in our review is noted by other authors as ?the 90:10 research gap,? where 90% of mental health research focuses on the 10% of the global population residing in high-income countries, including the United States [26].",Natural Language Processing and Social Determinants of Health in Mental Health Research: AI-Assisted Scoping Review

290,How do the unique cultural features of MCPP and PCPP as predictors of postpartum mental health factor into the model's development and potential application in diverse populations?,"Several study limitations need to be discussed. First, while the prospective design and robust internal validation via cross-validation strengthen methodological rigor, the absence of external validation on independent cohorts remains a critical constraint. The single-center nature of our dataset introduces potential selection bias and may limit the model?s generalizability to populations with distinct demographic profiles, clinical practices, or regional healthcare systems. To address this, future multicenter collaborations will be prioritized to validate and refine the model across diverse settings, ensuring broader clinical applicability. Second, this study primarily focused on second- and third-trimester pregnancies, and first-trimester information was not collected. In future studies, to further improve the accuracy, the number of variables or specific markers could be increased to estimate PPD. Finally, the women in the entire dataset could only be considered representative of the Chinese population with caution, and the risk assessment tools in postpartum were more likely suitable for women who were cared for by their mothers-in-law. MCPP and PCPP have unique Asian cultural features as predictors of postpartum and need to be considered in future research and clinical application.",Prediction of postpartum depression in women: development and validation of multiple machine learning models
291,Can you explain how SHAP values are used to provide more understandable interpretations of the model's predictions in the context of predicting postpartum depression risk?,"Despite the growing interest in ML models for clinical decision-making, most published prediction models never reach clinical practice. This may be because the models are difficult to understand or because the results lack representativeness and reproducibility [18]. In this study, we primarily included clinically applicable and easy to identify predictors. For clinical use of the optimal model, we designed various risk assessment tools to enable physicians to identify high-risk women immediately. According to the LR algorithm, the nomogram could serve as a tool to evaluate the risk ratio of PPD. On this basis, we developed a website calculator, which may be readily integrated into secondary care to improve screening efficiency and reduce the burden on physicians. In addition, applying risk scores opens new opportunities to enhance risk stratification and to help prevent PPD. Of note, due to its black-box nature, it is difficult for the ANN model to provide meaningful physician interpretations. Interpretability is generally defined as the ease with which humans can comprehend and explain the process of the ML model?s predictions [41]. To address this problem, we applied SHAP values to obtain more readily understandable interpretations. SHAP values are widely accepted and are useful for explaining the relationship between variables and outcomes [21]. It can help physicians better understand the model's decision-making process for appropriate early intervention for women with PPD. Overall, adopting risk assessment tools developed in this study could provide rapid results to physicians.",Prediction of postpartum depression in women: development and validation of multiple machine learning models
292,Can you provide more information on how prenatal anxiety and depression are common in pregnancy and how they are significantly associated with postpartum depression (PPD)?,"We selected 11 features associated with PPD, including MCPP, prenatal depression, neuroticism, prenatal anxiety, TC, PCPP, MT, marital satisfaction, primiparity, and FT3 (Fig.�3). Among them, MCPP, prenatal depression, prenatal anxiety, and neuroticism were determined to be the most significant predictors according to the SHAP value (Fig.�5). Our results indicated that low MCPP was significantly associated with an increased risk of PPD, which might be attributed to poor relationships between mothers-in-law and postpartum women [36]. In China, to help women recuperate after childbirth, mothers-in-law usually play an essential role in postnatal care for both the mother and baby during the postpartum period. However, conflicts between mothers-in-law and postpartum women are common due to different parenting views and lifestyles [4]. Thus, inadequate caregiving as a significant stressor increased PPD risk for Chinese women. This is concordant with our prior studies [37]. Notably, in our study, prenatal anxiety and prenatal depression were common in pregnancy and were significantly associated with PPD. This is supported by a large number of previous studies showing that prenatal depression and anxiety are strong predictors of PPD [1,�48]. One possible explanation is that pregnant women with depression or anxiety have more prolonged depressive or anxious symptoms, even into the postpartum period [23]. Another possible reason is that women with a history of mental disorders have a higher recurrence rate after delivery [15]. Interestingly, we found that neuroticism was a significant predictor associated with PPD. Originally defined by Eysenck, neuroticism is a key personality trait for affective processing [16]. Specifically, when faced with stress in the postpartum period, neurotic women tend to experience greater nervousness and are more likely to experience worrying and depression [35].",Prediction of postpartum depression in women: development and validation of multiple machine learning models
293,Can you explain how the SHAP values were used to determine the importance of predictors in the ANN model for predicting women's postpartum depression (PPD)?,"To explain the complex ANN model, we applied the SHAP value to illustrate how predictors affect women?s PPD. The feature importance and interpretation of the ANN model are shown in Fig.�5. The results demonstrated that the EPQ-N, MCPP, BDI, and BAI were significantly more important than other factors, as shown in Fig.�5A and�E. In addition, Fig.�5B and�F�clearly illustrate the strength and direction of every predictor. A higher MCPP score indicated a lower risk of PPD, and greater neuroticism was associated with a greater risk of PPD in the figures. For local interpretability, Fig.�5C, D, G, and H provides four typical relative samples and shows how the ANN models make clinical decisions for individual women. The SHAP value for every predictor as a force contributed to pushing the overall SHAP value (1?=?with PPD, 0?=?without PPD) higher (red) or pushing it lower (blue), and combined to predict the risk of PPD for individual women. For example, in Fig.�5C, one woman was predicted to suffer PPD due to FT3, EPQ-P, and BAI. The elevated risk was offset by the woman?s MT and EPQ-N.",Prediction of postpartum depression in women: development and validation of multiple machine learning models
294,"Can you provide more information on how the LR and ANN algorithms compare in terms of discrimination, calibration, and clinical net benefit in predicting women's postpartum depression (PPD)?","The discrimination, calibration, and clinical net benefit of the PN-PPD and PP-PPD models on the validation set are shown in Fig.�4. In contrast, the agreement between the observed and predicted events was relatively good with the LR and ANN algorithms and demonstrated a higher net clinical benefit across most ranges of threshold probabilities. On the other hand, compared to the PN-PPD models (except for the decision tree models), the PP-PPD models had higher reclassification and prediction ability (Supplementary Tables S9 and 10). In summary, these results suggest that the LR and ANN algorithms are the optimal ML models for predicting women?s PPD.",Prediction of postpartum depression in women: development and validation of multiple machine learning models

In addition, in the case of sparse data, categories were combined if necessary. In statistical description terms, continuous variables were described as the mean (SD) or median (interquartile range [IQR]) as appropriate. Correlations were determined by Pearson or Spearman analysis. The variance inflation factor (VIF) and tolerance were used to identify collinear independent variables. Univariate analysis was performed using the t-test, chi-square test, or Wilcoxon rank sum test. Statistical significance was defined as a two-sided P value?<?0.05.

Women who underwent obstetric examinations were recruited from a public tertiary maternity hospital between August 2021 and August 2022. To ensure sufficient registry information before and after childbirth, we only recruited women over 18 years of age, had a gestation period �?21 weeks, and underwent routine obstetric and laboratory examinations until delivery at this hospital. Women with pregnancy losses (including abortion, miscarriage, or stillbirth), as well as those with preterm deliveries (defined as deliveries occurring before 37 weeks of gestation), were excluded from the study. This exclusion was made to minimize the confounding effects of pregnancy-related complications on the prediction of PPD risk, as these conditions are associated with distinct psychological and physiological stressors. In addition, pregnant women diagnosed with fetal structural or chromosomal abnormalities were also excluded. In the study, all participants provided informed consent before participation and were asked to attend four follow-up visits for data collection: second trimester (gestation weeks 21?24), third trimester (gestation weeks 35?40), 2�weeks, and 6�weeks postpartum.",Prediction of postpartum depression in women: development and validation of multiple machine learning models
306,Can you provide examples of specific machine learning algorithms that have been used to develop prediction models for postpartum depression (PPD)?,"Recently, multiple studies developed prediction models to predict the risk of PPD in women, and most models showed good generalization performance and predictive capability [11]. Nevertheless, only a single type of feature selection method or model construction method was used in some studies [3,�46]. Recent literature on prediction models suggested that results from different prediction models would be potentially helpful for accuracy improvement [31]. On the other hand, similar to most psychiatric disorders, PPD has a complex etiology involving an interplay of biopsychosocial factors. Traditional modeling approaches have certain limitations in handling complex and multidimensional data [10]. With the advancement of computer technology and data sciences, the emergence of machine learning (ML) algorithms provides a powerful approach for addressing the limitations of traditional methods and has been widely applied to develop diagnostic or prognostic predictive models for improving health care in public health and medical research fields [30]. Unfortunately, some prediction models for PPD are based on complex ensemble learning algorithms, which may not be interpreted biologically [22,�49]. Moreover, few studies have been translated into clinical assessment tools to guide clinical decision-making.",Prediction of postpartum depression in women: development and validation of multiple machine learning models
307,How has the COVID-19 pandemic specifically impacted the mental health of perinatal women and contributed to the global public health problem of postpartum depression?,"The physical health of perinatal women has dramatically improved over the past few decades, leading to a substantial decline in miscarriage and mortality rates [25,�38]. However, their mental health has increasingly become a global public health problem [24]. Postpartum depression (PPD) is an apparent depressive symptom or a typical depressive episode in the perinatal period [45]. As the most common type of perinatal psychiatric syndrome, PPD is frequently characterized by persistent low mood, anhedonia, and loss of pleasure [2]. The largest and most inclusive meta-analysis of PPD to date found that the global pooled prevalence of PPD was 17.22% (95% CI 16.00%?18.51%) [43]. Notably, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has evolved into a global pandemic and further exacerbated mental health risks, especially in perinatal women [12]. Therefore, women?s postpartum depressive symptoms should receive adequate global public health attention during this period. Previous studies have suggested that PPD is affected by a complex combination of factors, such as demographic, physical, psychological, social, and obstetrics-related factors [8,�48]. However, the underlying mechanism of PPD remains unclear, so it is still an enormous challenge to prevent and intervene PPD.",Prediction of postpartum depression in women: development and validation of multiple machine learning models

The cross-validation results showed that the models built on logistic regression (LR) [area under the curve (AUC): 0.801, 0.858] and artificial neural network (ANN) (AUC: 0.787, 0.844) algorithms exhibited the best prediction performance. In contrast to the prenatal models, the addition of postpartum predictors (primary caregiver and mother-in-law?s care) remarkably improved the predictive performance of the postpartum models.

310,One question that I would ask for elaboration on would be: How can stakeholders such as policy makers contribute to addressing end user perceptions as a key barrier to implementing digital technology innovations in mental health care?,"Considering the findings from this review and wider research in this area, a key barrier to implementing digital technology innovations is end user perceptions rather than technology innovation itself [3]. Therefore, it will be important for future research to gain a deeper understanding of service user views as well as other stakeholders, such as policy makers. Further research into the efficacy of passive sensing and AI in mental health care is necessary to build an evidence base that would support the scaling up of these approaches to routine service delivery. Real-world studies implementing passive sensing and AI in practice are needed to understand the contextual factors that impact uptake, which will be useful to gain knowledge that can support the development of implementation frameworks [60].","Health Care Professionals' Views on the Use of Passive Sensing, AI, and Machine Learning in Mental Health Care: Systematic Review With Meta-Synthesis"
311,Can you explain how meta-synthesis allows for greater scope and generalizability compared to individual primary studies in qualitative research?,"Meta-synthesis allows for greater scope and generalizability than individual primary studies [55]. However, as data are transposed into third-order constructs, there is potential for the findings to move away from the empirical, conceptual, and theoretical contexts of primary qualitative studies [56]. Of the papers included, 2 used content analysis, which is a more descriptive approach to coding and data interpretation (Vaismoradi et al [57]). Thus, the findings may have been more heavily influenced by studies that used more robust qualitative methods, such as thematic analysis, which can provide a more detailed and nuanced account of the data (Braun and Clarke [58]). Furthermor e, the process and methods of meta-synthesis are heavily influenced by the focus and expertise of the authors, meaning that some concepts and theories may not have been considered. This limitation was managed through discussion with the research team on coding and themes as well as remaining attuned to personal perspectives that could introduce bias [59].","Health Care Professionals' Views on the Use of Passive Sensing, AI, and Machine Learning in Mental Health Care: Systematic Review With Meta-Synthesis"
312,Can you provide more information on the training aspects discussed for clinicians in incorporating passive sensing and AI methods into their practice?,"Across studies, clinicians discussed the impact that use of passive sensing and AI could have on their workload. Concerns appeared to be around reviewing significant amounts of data to identify clinically relevant information and risk monitoring. However, previous research has suggested that AI may in fact reduce clinicians? workloads, as less time will be required to read through notes to understand a service user?s history, particularly because certain AI methods, such as natural language processing, could be applied to patient notes to summarize important information [50]. Furthermore, machine learning methods can facilitate work by highlighting previously inaccessible or less understood symptoms and patterns [6]. It has also been suggested that data received by clinicians regarding a service user?s behavior may allow them to identify those most in need of support and prioritize their workload, thus using their time more effectively [51]. To reduce concerns about increased workload, it would be useful for clinicians to receive data in a user-friendly format, allowing seamless access to relevant information. If devices and associated systems are not considered user-friendly and there are multiple technical issues, this will likely result in frustration and reluctance to engage [52]. Along with ease of use, training was discussed as a means to encourage clinicians to engage with devices that allow passive sensing and applied AI methods in their practice. Ways to make training useful for clinicians included ensuring that clinicians have access to clear guidance around incorporating data flows into their practice, managing risk issues, and data privacy and protection procedures. The latter is especially pertinent, as concerns about data security were a reoccurring theme throughout studies. Transparent guidelines will need to be developed, and codes of practice enforced around storage, ownership, and sharing of data [52]. However, it has been suggested that concerns about confidentiality of data may always remain; therefore, to facilitate engagement, the perceived value to clinicians and service users will need to outweigh these concerns [53]. As discussed in the reviewed studies, training should involve increasing awareness of the evidence base so that clinicians can understand the cost-benefits of engaging in passive sensing and AI in practice.","Health Care Professionals' Views on the Use of Passive Sensing, AI, and Machine Learning in Mental Health Care: Systematic Review With Meta-Synthesis"
313,Can you provide more information on how digital tools and apps can act as change agents in forming a therapeutic alliance with service users in mental health care?,"The influence that the use of passive sensing and applied AI methods could have on the therapeutic relationship was further discussed across papers. Although service users should feel empowered to make choices and manage their own mental health, access to human in-person support is deemed necessary. This reflects concerns that the use of AI in health care could lead to neglect of the therapeutic aspects of in-person consultation, such as consideration of motivation and self-advocacy, attendance to nonverbal cues, and social connection that can be provided by in-person clinical contact [44]. Fears were further raised that the absence of a therapeutic relationship may lead service users to disengage or refuse mental health care altogether. Research suggests that a therapeutic alliance can exist between a person seeking change and a change agent, which does not necessarily have to be a human health care professional, with digital tools and apps themselves having the potential to act as change agents [45].","Health Care Professionals' Views on the Use of Passive Sensing, AI, and Machine Learning in Mental Health Care: Systematic Review With Meta-Synthesis"
314,How can changes in mental states affect a person's capacity to make decisions?,"It is important to ensure that service users have capacity when making these decisions, as mental states can change and influence decision-making [32].","Health Care Professionals' Views on the Use of Passive Sensing, AI, and Machine Learning in Mental Health Care: Systematic Review With Meta-Synthesis"
315,What specific types of personal data are collected through passive sensing devices and how does this potential increase in data collection impact privacy concerns in mental health app usage?,"Participants reported that in practice, they will often recommend apps to service users without reviewing privacy policies, citing a lack of time as the reason for not investigating this further [23]. However, in most studies, concerns have been raised regarding privacy in relation to passive sensing data. It has been suggested that the collection of personal data through digital devices that allow passive sensing could increase the risk of loss of confidentiality and misuse of data [34,36], which could negatively impact therapeutic relationships [10]. In line with this, it was felt that service users would have less control over what they chose to share, which may feel uncomfortable for service users and lead clinicians to feel as though they are invading their privacy [10,23]:","Health Care Professionals' Views on the Use of Passive Sensing, AI, and Machine Learning in Mental Health Care: Systematic Review With Meta-Synthesis"
316,How can clinicians help service users manage their data to prevent false expectations?,"Ng et al [33] highlighted the importance of clinicians, suggesting alternate ways for service users to frame or interact with their data. This may be important in ensuring that recommendations delivered to service users do not arouse false expectations of users [37]:","Health Care Professionals' Views on the Use of Passive Sensing, AI, and Machine Learning in Mental Health Care: Systematic Review With Meta-Synthesis"
317,How can self-management strategies in mental health care contribute to reducing the demand for services like hospital admissions?,"This self-management could increase awareness of early warning signs, reduce the risk of relapse, and therefore decrease demand for services, for example, by reducing hospital admissions [36].","Health Care Professionals' Views on the Use of Passive Sensing, AI, and Machine Learning in Mental Health Care: Systematic Review With Meta-Synthesis"
318,How do researchers suggest that passive sensing and AI in mental health care could potentially empower service users?,"Throughout the studies, findings on the consequences that passive sensing and AI in mental health care could have for service users were discussed. There appeared to be a positive notion that this could empower service users, although it was also acknowledged that there could be risks to service users? well-being. Concerns have also been raised regarding the protection and safety of service users? data.","Health Care Professionals' Views on the Use of Passive Sensing, AI, and Machine Learning in Mental Health Care: Systematic Review With Meta-Synthesis"
319,How can clear procedures and guidance help clinicians in utilizing digital technologies effectively in the context of mental health?,"Clinicians may differ in technological literacy, and some may generally find technology challenging [35]. It was discussed that this technology will only be useful if clinicians understand it and feel comfortable using it [23]. For training to be adequate, it was suggested that clinicians would value clear procedures and guidance on when and how these digital technologies should be used [10], how to connect the data to their established clinical practice [33], and how to interpret data. Depending on the condition, certain markers of behavior could be interpreted positively or negatively [3]. Clinicians would also require clear guidelines regarding responsibility, interoperability, information governance, and potential risks [36]:","Health Care Professionals' Views on the Use of Passive Sensing, AI, and Machine Learning in Mental Health Care: Systematic Review With Meta-Synthesis"
320,Can you provide examples of how including relevant stakeholders in the development of AI technologies can ensure the use of accessible language and the presentation of data in a simple way for better understanding?,"To ensure ease of use, suggestions were made, such as including relevant stakeholders in the development of such technologies and related systems to ensure that they use accessible language [37] and presenting the data in a simple way that is easy to understand [3]:","Health Care Professionals' Views on the Use of Passive Sensing, AI, and Machine Learning in Mental Health Care: Systematic Review With Meta-Synthesis"
321,How do clinicians view the role of digital tools in enhancing practice and strengthening the therapeutic relationship with service users?,"Having said this, it was proposed that allowing service users to submit data to clinicians, who could then respond with recommendations, would enable remote support and continuity of care, which could strengthen the therapeutic relationship [23]. It appeared that the general consensus was that although digital tools may enhance practice, they should not replace service user or staff interactions, something which was viewed as integral to the therapeutic relationship [32].","Health Care Professionals' Views on the Use of Passive Sensing, AI, and Machine Learning in Mental Health Care: Systematic Review With Meta-Synthesis"
322,What specific factors contribute to the potential loss of empathy and inaccurate interpretations of service users' presentations when using digital tools and AI methods in therapy?,"An issue that arose across studies was the impact that use of passive sensing and AI in practice could have on the therapeutic relationships. Some service users may prefer in-person consultations [35]; therefore, using digital tools and AI methods as a replacement of human contact could be determinantal to the therapeutic alliance [3] because of a loss of empathy and inaccurate interpretations of service users? presentations [34]:","Health Care Professionals' Views on the Use of Passive Sensing, AI, and Machine Learning in Mental Health Care: Systematic Review With Meta-Synthesis"
323,"As a student fascinated by the implications of advancements in AI on mental health, I would like to know more about how the concern of risk management in utilizing AI tools in healthcare settings can potentially act as a barrier to engagement for both healthcare providers and patients, as mentioned in the text.","Managing risk was another concern raised, with participants wondering about their clinical responsibility for monitoring the data for risk issues [3,10,35] because responding to constant data streams would not be possible [23]. This is important because risk aversion is cited as a potential barrier to engagement [36].","Health Care Professionals' Views on the Use of Passive Sensing, AI, and Machine Learning in Mental Health Care: Systematic Review With Meta-Synthesis"
324,How do clinicians perceive the impact of passive sensing and AI on their workloads in relation to incorporating data flows into their practice?,"A further barrier discussed was the impact of passive sensing and AI could have on clinicians? workloads. Clinicians wondered about the amount of time and effort required to incorporate data flows into their practice and whether they would be required to review data before sessions [33], which could result in clinicians trawling through a significant amount of data to generate actionable insights [3]. Indeed, participants reported feeling ?overwhelmed? when presented with passively collected data [23]:","Health Care Professionals' Views on the Use of Passive Sensing, AI, and Machine Learning in Mental Health Care: Systematic Review With Meta-Synthesis"
325,What specific concerns were raised by participants regarding the potential negative impact on the therapeutic relationship when using passive sensing and AI in mental health care?,"Throughout the papers, participants discussed the perceived barriers to and facilitators of using passive sensing and AI in mental health care. The barriers discussed included access, concerns about clinicians? workloads, and the potential negative impact on the therapeutic relationship. Facilitators included ease of use and training.","Health Care Professionals' Views on the Use of Passive Sensing, AI, and Machine Learning in Mental Health Care: Systematic Review With Meta-Synthesis"
326,How can AI be used to track the efficacy of brief interventions in therapeutic work?,"Further suggestions were made as to how passive sensing and AI could be useful in therapeutic work, such as guiding productive discussions [33], setting treatment goals, delivering low-intensity support [3], tracking the efficacy of brief interventions [23], and encouraging ongoing engagement and regular self-reflection [38]. Furthermore, discussions were conducted about how AI?s ability to process, connect, and make conclusions from large amounts of data could be used to risk-stratify service users according to their personal factors and needs [36] and support identification and awareness of early warning signs, thus reducing the risk of relapse of mental health difficulties [32-34,37]. As clinicians have access to these data, it was also felt that they could identify when to intervene [38], which may further reduce a service user?s risk of deterioration in mental health [10]. Indeed, clinicians have reported that seeing a change in the data regarding a service user?s speech and self-care habits would promote awareness of a decline in their well-being [3]. This was considered useful in community and ward environments, where staff may not always have eyes on service users [32], particularly for those who may lack insight into their difficulties or do not volunteer information themselves [23,32]:","Health Care Professionals' Views on the Use of Passive Sensing, AI, and Machine Learning in Mental Health Care: Systematic Review With Meta-Synthesis"
327,What specific barriers to the use of passive sensing and AI in clinical practice were identified in the analysis?,"Analysis of the data revealed three distinct but interrelated themes: (1) the use of passive sensing and AI in clinical practice, (2) barriers to and facilitators of use in practice, and (3) consequences for service users. A total of 5 subthemes were identified from the data. The themes, subthemes, and relationships between them are summarized in�Figure 2.","Health Care Professionals' Views on the Use of Passive Sensing, AI, and Machine Learning in Mental Health Care: Systematic Review With Meta-Synthesis"
328,What were the different approaches used in the studies to analyze the data collected from health care professionals regarding the implications of advancements in AI on mental health?,"A total of 10 papers were deemed eligible for inclusion in this review. A total of 3 studies were conducted in the United Kingdom, 1 in India, 1 in the United States, 1 across both the United States and India, 1 in Australia, 2 in Germany, and 1 in a global study. In total, 6 studies used thematic analysis, 1 used a grounded theory approach, 1 used qualitative descriptive analysis, and 2 used content analysis. Participants in 4 of the papers were health care professionals only, with the remaining 6 papers including health care professionals as well as other stakeholders, such as service users and their families, technology experts, and technology company owners. The findings were only included if they were explicitly associated with health care professionals. The number of health care professionals ranged from 2 to 53 (mean 17). The age of the mental health professionals where this was reported (6 papers) ranged from 22 to 72 years. Among the 5 papers that reported gender, 28 participants were male, and 42 were female. Owing to the high number of participants in the global web-based survey [34], these data are described separately, with 791 participants taking part, ranging in age from 25 to �65 years. Of the participants, 550 identified as male, 230 identified as female, and 11 identified as others.","Health Care Professionals' Views on the Use of Passive Sensing, AI, and Machine Learning in Mental Health Care: Systematic Review With Meta-Synthesis"

332,What are the specific goals of conducting a meta-synthesis on mental health care professionals' views on the use of passive sensing and AI in mental health care?,"Although there have been some qualitative studies exploring mental health care professionals? views and experiences of passive sensing and AI in mental health care, there are no published reviews that systematically aggregate these findings, specifically through examining participants? experiences and perspectives, both deeply (because of the qualitative approach) and broadly (because of the integration of studies from different health care contexts and participants) [20]. This meta-synthesis aims to synthesize and evaluate the relative strengths of the qualitative literature regarding mental health care professionals? views on the use of passive sensing and AI in mental health care to provide a new, comprehensive interpretation of the findings that goes beyond the depth and breadth of the original studies [21]. Although research continues to grow in this area, it is now an appropriate time to review the literature, as the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the urgency for creating digital interventions that can fulfill the full potential of digital health [22], and it is necessary to engage multiple stakeholder groups early in the design and development process [23].","Health Care Professionals' Views on the Use of Passive Sensing, AI, and Machine Learning in Mental Health Care: Systematic Review With Meta-Synthesis"
333,How can passive sensing data and machine learning support more precise diagnoses and prognoses in mental health care?,"Mental health problems are highly prevalent globally, with approximately 1 in 8 people experiencing mental health difficulties, which can have significant personal and economic consequences [1]. Rapid growth in digital technology innovation has led to an increased interest in digital mental health interventions [2]. Digital tools with built-in sensors, such as smartphones, smartwatches, and other wearable devices, allow for the unobtrusive and continuous collection of objective data, providing insight into user behavior and physiology [3]. Machine learning, which is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI), can be applied to these data to�learn�from it and generate clinically actionable insights and predictions [4]. It has therefore been suggested that passive sensing data and applied machine learning methods could overcome what some describe as trial-and-error?driven approaches used in mental health care by supporting precise diagnoses and prognoses [5]. Indeed, mental health remains one of the only domains in health care that relies only on service users? self-report of cognitive and emotional states and symptoms and on clinicians to accurately recognize and map these states to make diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic decisions [6]. Passive sensing data and AI may offer a means to overcome the pitfalls of current clinical measures by presenting a more complete picture of a person?s difficulties [7]. For example, raw sensor data captured regarding speech characteristics, location, and activity can be transformed to derive high-level behavioral markers, such as fatigue, sleep disruption, and mood, which can be used to identify clinical states, such as depression [8]. In addition, digital tools that allow for passive sensing can support service users? self-management of symptoms and access to digitally delivered therapies [4]. Through self-management, service users may feel empowered [9], and service user and clinician access to digital remote data capture has the potential to identify early warning signs of deterioration, providing the opportunity to reduce the risk of relapse of mental health difficulties via early identification and intervention [10]. This may be particularly useful, as current health care systems generally rely on the delivery of treatment by scheduled appointments, which can result in warning signs of mental health relapse being missed or treated too late [11]. Using sensors from digital tools, such as smartphones and wearable devices, to identify clinical and behavioral features of worsening mental health and applying machine learning methods to identify patterns in the data could augment mental health care by delivering more precise treatment at the time it is needed [12].","Health Care Professionals' Views on the Use of Passive Sensing, AI, and Machine Learning in Mental Health Care: Systematic Review With Meta-Synthesis"

336,"As a student fascinated by the implications of AI on mental health, I would like to know more about the specific ethical principles that AI/ML developers need to prioritize in the context of healthcare, as highlighted in the World Health Organization's guidance mentioned in the text.","The integration of AI/ML in healthcare brings forth numerous ethical and regulatory concerns that could potentially impede their implementation. Recently, the World Health Organization issued new guidance on the ethics and governance of AI technology applications in healthcare [123], emphasizing the need for AI/ML developers to prioritize ethical principles. To facilitate the potential implementation of AI/ML tools in dementia diagnosis and management, we also advocate for the development of local guidelines to fit the culture/religious needs. On the regulatory front, compliance with healthcare regulations is indispensable. Regulatory bodies, such as FDA, the European Medicines Agency, and the Therapeutic Goods administration (Australia), should get prepared for processing more applications for AI/ML medical devices in the future. A clear approach must be established for post-deployment continuous monitoring and reporting, to maintain their safety and effectiveness in the clinic [122]. More importantly, it is crucial that regulations should clearly define the responsibilities and accountabilities of AI/ML developers and healthcare providers for any errors generated by AI/ML tools. This includes specifying the extent of liability for developers in the event of AI/ML malfunction or incorrect predictions, as well as outlining the role of healthcare providers in interpretating AI/ML outputs before making clinical decisions. Regulations should also detail mechanisms for reporting and addressing errors, as well as protocols for updating and improving AI/ML tools from reported errors. An in-depth discussion on regulatory matters concerning ML/AI is outside the scope of this review. Regulatory bodies, clinicians, and public health experts are encouraged to work on regulatory matters to prepare our healthcare systems for the implementation of AI/ML tools.",Understanding machine learning applications in dementia research and clinical practice: a review for biomedical scientists and clinicians
337,Can you provide more information on how offering a personalized approach and giving individuals the option to opt in or out of predictive analyses can promote autonomy in older adults when using ML-dementia tools?,"To address these challenges and improve acceptance among older adults, several steps should be taken. Increasing public awareness of ML and its benefits in healthcare is crucial, as many people may not realize that AI/ML are already being used. Ensuring transparency in data usage and robust data security measures can help build trust, while�offering a personalized approach where individuals can opt in or out of predictive analyses can promote autonomy [120]. Providing comprehensive psychological support can help individuals cope with the emotional impact of potential diagnoses and empower them to make informed decisions about their health and care plans.

While ML applications have�yet to be�implemented in�dementia clinical practice, anticipated challenges must be considered for future implementation in dementia diagnosis and care.",Understanding machine learning applications in dementia research and clinical practice: a review for biomedical scientists and clinicians
339,Can you provide examples of how the lack of generalizability in longitudinal datasets can impact the development and application of machine learning models in predicting and tracking Alzheimer's disease progression?,"A longitudinal dataset may lack of generalizability. The study setting and enrolment criteria would exclude certain populations based on ethnicity, education level, socio-economic status, or comorbid conditions. For example, research studies might exclude participants with severe cardiovascular diseases or advanced diabetes, arguing that these conditions could confound the cognitive assessments used to diagnose and track ADem progression [113]. Moreover, studies that require participants to be English-speaking exclude individuals from a culturally and linguistically diverse background (e.g., the indigenous population in Australia, who have a higher risk of ADem). These exclusions can result in datasets that fail to fully represent the diverse population affected by dementia. The clinical application of ML models built from biased data will consequently be limited. Collaborative efforts between researchers, clinicians, and regulatory bodies are crucial in developing criteria that balance scientific rigor with practical feasibility. Furthermore, the major dementia longitudinal studies are often restricted to national boundaries, constraining their generalizability and the assessment of their performance in more border real-world scenarios. Researchers are encouraged to employ multiple datasets, where the model is trained on one dataset (e.g., ADNI) and validated on another dataset (e.g., AIBL) [114] to address this challenge.",Understanding machine learning applications in dementia research and clinical practice: a review for biomedical scientists and clinicians
340,How do the inconsistencies and lack of uniformity in existing longitudinal datasets impact the development and validation of machine learning models for mental health assessment and treatment?,"The existing longitudinal datasets exhibit a lack of uniformity and standardized approach in sample/data collection and record format, making it difficult to validate and compare metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity between ML models that built on different datasets [109]. For example, although AIBL and ROSMAP collected depression related data, yet different scales were used?AIBL adapted the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale while ROSMAP used the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale. The lack of uniformity in data collection could also be attributed to the intrinsic nature of the technology. For example, various platforms, techniques, and environmental factors could introduce biases and variabilities into omics dataset [110]. In addition, omics data is often noisy and sparse, especially when detecting molecules of low abundance, and therefore more prone to batch effect. Furthermore, different annotation systems or reference databases used to identify proteins, metabolites, and genes can lead to mismatches and inconsistencies. Also, different omics dataset may lack of common features due to experiment set up. All these make it less practical to standardize the omics data.",Understanding machine learning applications in dementia research and clinical practice: a review for biomedical scientists and clinicians
341,"Can you explain how data imbalance in dementia datasets can affect the performance of machine learning models, and what techniques can be used to address this issue?","Given the complex set up of longitudinal studies and heterogenous disease pathology, missing values, outliers, data imbalance are inevitable. Missing data is often due to incomplete responses, data collection errors, technical issues and participant withdrawal [96]. Data scientists either disregard participants with missing data or use imputation techniques (e.g., mean imputation, multiple imputation by chained equations, etc. [97]). Outliers normally result from errors from record, measurement or misclassification. Statistic techniques, such as�z-scores and interquartile range or box plot are used to detect outliers. Once identified, common approaches involve removing outliers, adjusting into specific percentile, or applying transformations to reduce the skewness of the data distribution [98]. Data imbalance is a commonly encountered issue for dementia dataset, as MCI and ADem occur in a smaller population compared to CU. When MCI/ADem cases are significantly underrepresented compared to CU, it can lead to a biased model performance, where ML models trained on imbalanced data may prioritize the majority and struggle to accurately predict the minority [99]. To address this issue, resampling techniques such as Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique [100] can be employed.",Understanding machine learning applications in dementia research and clinical practice: a review for biomedical scientists and clinicians
342,Could you provide more information on how the lack of a universally accepted threshold for binary classification in studies on predictive modeling of cognitive impairment using AI could impact the reliability and comparability of results?,"Notably, a�universally accepted threshold to determine binary classification�is lacking. For example, Langford et al. [85] used a threshold of 1.15, while Palmqvist et al. [84] adopted a threshold of 0.738. Whether this would have impacted the prediction performance of the model is unclear. Future studies should consider standardizing this threshold to enable comparisons between models. Another issue with these studies is that the datasets used for model training are relatively small (e.g., 300 participants for Palmqvist et al. [84]�and 800 participants for Zhang et al. [89]), possibly due to cost constraints associated with PET and MRI. Research funding bodies could play a role in encouraging (inter)national collaboration and data sharing, as well as endorsing standard data formats (especially for those high-cost experiments) to increase the size of datasets for more robust results.",Understanding machine learning applications in dementia research and clinical practice: a review for biomedical scientists and clinicians
343,Can you elaborate further on how fixed interval models differ from simulation methods in predicting disease progression?,"Mukherji et al. [81], Bucholc et al. [82] and Lian et al. [78] predict disease progression over a fixed interval, while Jiang et al. [76] and Zou et al. [83] simulate disease progression. It should be noted that simulation methods introduce higher variance and complexity compared to fixed interval models [95]; however, they can predict disease status at any time point, whereas fixed interval models can only predict disease status at the end of the interval. Different models may suit varying�clinical needs or patient expectations, each balancing its own advantages and limitations. In addition, these complex models are prone to overfitting [94], capturing noise that does not generalize to unseen data. This issue could be exacerbated in studies where the training datasets are relatively small, such as that for�Jiang et al. [76] (165 MCI stable, 137 MCI progressor). We have also noted that most of these models, except Lian et al. [78], involve various neuropsychological tests, which often differ between studies. This makes it challenging for external validation and comparison between different models. Future studies should consider developing models based on neuropsychological tests that are routinely used in clinics for easier evaluation, validation and potential implementation.",Understanding machine learning applications in dementia research and clinical practice: a review for biomedical scientists and clinicians
344,"Can you explain how the ensemble model used by Mofrad et al. for predicting MCI progression to dementia differs from a random forest model, and how it incorporates MRI data for prediction accuracy?","The prediction of future disease states or neuropsychological outcomes can be achieved using classification and regression models, as well as simulating disease trajectories using more complex deep learning models (Table�7C). Most classification models categorize MCI-to-dementia progressors and non-progressors. For example, Rye et.al. [72] achieved a 75% of accuracy in predicting whether MCI participants progress to dementia using a random forest model, where neuropsychological evaluation, hippocampal volume and Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype were used as input features. An ensemble model was employed by Mofrad et al. [79] for such prediction, where MRI and neuropsychological evaluation were used to achieve a 77% accuracy. Regression models often employ neuropsychological evaluation, such as CDR-SB, ADAS-Cog, and MMSE [77,�78,�82], to estimate disease severity over time. For example, Lian et al. [78] employed a multitask weakly-supervised Attention Network, which is a regression model that built on structural MRI data collected from CU, MCI progressor, MCI non-progressor, and ADem participants to predict 3-year future CDR-SB, ADAS-Cog, and MMSE scores. This model has achieved promising results, with a root-mean-squared error of 1.5, 5.7, and 2.2 for each score, respectively.",Understanding machine learning applications in dementia research and clinical practice: a review for biomedical scientists and clinicians
345,Can you explain how the deep belief network-based approach outperformed SVM and Naïve Bayes in binary classification of CU and ADem using multi-omics data?,"Predicting disease stages using either a binary classification (CU vs ADem, CU vs MCI?+?ADem, CU vs MCI, MCI vs ADem) or CU/MCI/ADem classification is commonly used in ML-dementia. These typically employ omics data [69,�74], neuropsychological evaluation [70], and neuroimaging [68,�70,�71] (Table�7B). Mahendran et al. [74] demonstrated that deep belief network-based approach (accuracy 82%) outperformed SVM (accuracy 78%) and Na�ve Bayes (accuracy 76%) in binary classification of CU and ADem using their multi-omics data. In another study, Wang et al. [69] utilized six differentially expressed metabolites, three metabolic pathways and a random forest model to differentiate the MCI?+?ADem group from CU, and they achieved an AUC of 0.77. MRI data have also been employed to facilitate disease classification. For instance, Naz et al. utilized only structural MRI data [71], and achieved a classification accuracy of 99.27, 98.89 and 97.06% for MCI/ADem, ADem/CU, and MCI/CU, respectively. To generate more complex models, multimodal data (e.g., demographic, medical history, brain volume, neuropsychological evaluation�and�genetics) have been integrated, such as convolutional neural network model for disease stage classification. For example, using multimodality, Venugopalan et al. [70] achieved a classification accuracy of 83% for CU, 74% for MCI and 85% for ADem.",Understanding machine learning applications in dementia research and clinical practice: a review for biomedical scientists and clinicians
346,"How do machine learning and deep learning models utilize metabolomics and neuroimaging data to accurately differentiate between different types of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies?","AD is the major cause of dementia, followed by vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies [90]. Accurate differential diagnosis is important for clinicians to offer the most suitable care options to the patients [91]. Recent studies utilizing ML and deep learning models have shown relative high accuracy in differential diagnoses by incorporating metabolomics [67] and neuroimaging [64?66] (Table�7A). For instance, Qiang et al. [67] established the associations between 249 metabolites and type of dementia (all-cause dementia, ADem, and vascular dementia) using UK Biobank data. The study employed Cox proportional hazard models and light gradient boosting machine algorithms to generate a metabolic risk score. This score when combined with demographic and neuropsychological test scores achieved an AUC of 0.85 (AUC approaching 1 indicates excellence in discrimination) for the classification of different types of dementia. By employing neuroimaging data, Castellazzi et al. [92] used the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems to distinguish between ADem and vascular dementia. This achieved over 84% accuracy using a combination of features from resting-state functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging. Moreover, another independent research group [65] achieved?~?80% accuracy in differentiating dementia with Lewy bodies from ADem using structural MRI data and a residual neural network. Finally, Nguyen et al. [66] introduced an innovative approach, by integrating 3D U-Nets with a multi-layer perceptron classifier to discern ADem from frontotemporal dementia through structural MRI images, attaining an AUC of 0.94.",Understanding machine learning applications in dementia research and clinical practice: a review for biomedical scientists and clinicians
347,How do the different levels of invasiveness in data/sample collection methods impact the accuracy and reliability of biomarker research in Alzheimer's disease studies?,"A variety of data/sample collection methods have been employed in these studies, which can be categorized as per their level of invasiveness (Table�2). Invasive methods, such as cerebrospinal fluid collection through lumbar puncture, are commonly used to obtain biomarkers (A?�and tau) and markers of neurodegeneration [1]. The AT(N) 2018 framework [58], categorizes the progression of AD into different stages based on specific combinations of these biomarkers (Table�4). Compared to lumbar puncture, venous blood collection is considered less-invasive, and often used for biomarker research and omics (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) analysis [59]. Non-invasive methods such as MRI and PET are employed to study brain structure and A? levels [1]. Neuropsychological evaluation (Table�5) are also non-invasive, which are quantitative measures of cognitive functions across various disease stages (Table�6) [60]. Demographic�information, lifestyle data and�medical history are often self-reported or collected using questionnaires and are used as baseline predictors in the majority of studies [61].",Understanding machine learning applications in dementia research and clinical practice: a review for biomedical scientists and clinicians

349,"How have machine learning models, such as support vector machines, been utilized in research related to Alzheimer's disease and cognitive impairment in recent years, and what specific advancements have been made in predicting clinical progression using these models in conjunction with brain imaging techniques?","Prior to the year 2000, research primarily focused on clarifying the genetic and biochemical foundations of AD, with significant emphasis on the roles of A? and familial genetic mutations [51]. In the subsequent decade (2000?2010), scholarly attention shifted towards differentiating AD from CU mostly using ML model such as support vector machines alongside brain imaging techniques [52]. In the following five years or so, researchers focused on predicting clinical progress in MCI patients using multi-kernel support vector machine (SVM, a ML model) with longitudinal data from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) [53].",Understanding machine learning applications in dementia research and clinical practice: a review for biomedical scientists and clinicians
350,Can you explain the difference between model-free and model-based reinforcement learning and how they can be applied in the context of predicting cognitive states?,"Reinforcement learning (RL) is used to learn and improve decision making by continuously receiving feedback through interaction with external conditions and observing the response. This approach is less commonly used than the supervised and unsupervised methods. RL can be classified as model-free and model-based types; model-free RL operates without a predefined model, while model-based RL is preferred for incorporating domain knowledge (i.e., existing clinical knowledge). RL could mainly be employed to simulate and predict cognitive states, as well as to estimate the probability of transitioning between cognitive�states.",Understanding machine learning applications in dementia research and clinical practice: a review for biomedical scientists and clinicians

353,How does machine learning specifically enhance the effectiveness and productivity of data-driven research in the context of longitudinal dementia datasets?,"Observational longitudinal dementia datasets have been collected in diverse age groups across several (inter)national dementia cohorts (Table�1), providing rich information that enhances the granularity and scope of data science research. These datasets encompass a broad spectrum of information including biomarkers, genetics, neuropsychological evaluations, neuroimaging, omics, etc. (Table�2). Traditional statistical methods, constrained by rigid assumptions and a limited ability to handle complex interactions have shown limitations in processing these multi-modal datasets, prompting an exploration of more adaptive and comprehensive techniques such as machine learning (ML) [2]. ML is a class of algorithms that enable computers to analyze data and make decisions by identifying patterns specific to tasks [3]. These techniques can detect subtle patterns and trends in large datasets, significantly enhancing the�effectiveness and productivity of data-driven research. In addition,�ML has already proven successful in tracking�disease, including market-ready products (e.g., Vivid E80 [4]) and FDA-approved devices (e.g., Apple's Atrial Fibrillation History Feature [5]).",Understanding machine learning applications in dementia research and clinical practice: a review for biomedical scientists and clinicians

355,How do machine learning approaches in suicide prevention research contribute to a more pro-active approach to preventing harmful reporting in media?,"The current work makes a relevant contribution to suicide prevention research in that it investigates and confirms, for the first time, that machine learning can be successfully applied to assess prevention-relevant characteristics in broadcast media items. This included not only relative straight-forward but also more difficult characteristics of suicide-related media content such as the solution or problem focus of a media item. Recent studies about media content characteristics and their association with suicides have been limited in terms of number of media items included due to the huge amount of resources needed to assess media items. Similar limitations apply to the screening and surveillance of suicide-related media content that would allow a more pro-active approach to prevention such as the early reaching out to journalists and media professionals in instances of harmful reporting. Although this work does not replace human coding, it provides a strong basis for the extension to other media characteristics of interest, and subsequently, for the automatic assessment of large numbers of media items and their possible associations with behavioral outcomes of interest. Taken together, the current results highlight the relevance of machine learning approaches for future media studies related to suicide and prevention.",A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media
356,Can you provide examples of how these categorizations can be applied in suicide research and prevention efforts?,"Although these categorizations do not capture all of the characteristics listed in media guidelines, they are of high relevance for suicide research and prevention as they allow for a more fine-grained categorization of texts as compared to simple keyword searches.",A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media
357,Can you provide more examples of classification categories that were easier to classify with high performance despite low training sample sizes in the study?,"Independent from sample size, some types of classifications were indeed easier than others as we had assumed. Celebrity suicide could be classified very well (F1>.90) despite low positive case examples. The main focus categories assisted suicide, attempted suicide or murder-suicide are further such examples, very reasonably high performance (F1>.80) was possible with very low training sample sizes. However, at least in some of these cases, machine learning does not provide a substantial advantage over keyword searches, since they are easily identified with a few highly indicative keywords (names of celebrities + suicide, euthanasia, suicide bombing, attempt + suicide etc).",A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media
358,"Can you explain further why the frequency of keywords is considered a useful feature for detecting more instances when training sample sizes are small, and how this relates to the performance of the deep learning model in detecting positive classes with limited training examples?","A few points are interesting to mention regarding a comparison of Tf-idf with SVM and BERT results. Overall, we observed no clear advantage of BERT over Tf-idf with SVM. In contrast, BERT clearly outperformed Tf-idf with SVM when predicting similar suicide-related characteristics in tweets, that is, very short texts [11]. Possibly, the deep learning model?s capacity to predict the meaning of each word from the specific context it occurs in may be less crucial when working with longer content types, like the current broadcast media items. Here, we generally observed lower recall scores for BERT than Tf-idf with SVM for the positive class in all binary tasks where there were few training examples for the positive class (all except suicide death). This shows that the frequency of keywords is a useful feature to detect more instances when training sample sizes are small, and that especially the recall (the detection rate) of the deep learning model is sensitive to small class size (as here for positive classes).",A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media
359,Can you provide more detail on how the sample size impacted the performance of BERT in the study on healing stories?,"Regarding the featuring of a ?healing story?, which have been at the forefront of the discourse of positive media potentials, ie the Papageno effect [6?9], the sample size in the current sample (there were n = 190 total healing story transcripts included) was comparable to a previous study conducted with Tweets [11]. For tweets, precision and recall using tf-idf with SVM were 0.44 (precision) and 0.64 (recall) in a 6-category classification task. For BERT, precision was 0.76 and recall was again 0.76 [11]. In the current study, sample size really determined performance (category yes with precision and recall of ~0.5 vs. no 0.97). The Twitter study suggests that having more balanced classes can improve performance for BERT for such small sample sizes.",A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media
360,How does the use of keyword searches for suicide reports compare to the approach used in this study in terms of accuracy and specificity?,"A second characteristic that could be classified with high precision and recall was suicide deaths reports, where sufficient examples for the negative and positive class, allowed for scores above .80. This is likely much better than what keyword searches for suicide reports can achieve, which have the problem of mixing heterogeneous types of content containing the same keywords, together. Niederkrotenthaler et al., 2020 noted accordingly that most of the research about associations of suicide reporting and subsequent suicides was based on keyword searches only, mixing together entirely different types of narratives and contents and ignoring their potentially different meaning and effects [4].",A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media
361,How do the results of using machine learning models in classifying suicide-related broadcast media content compare to earlier work that demonstrated the efficiency of machine learning in classifying social media content for suicide prevention efforts?,"Overall, our results demonstrate that machine learning models can in principle achieve very satisfactory results for classifying various types of characteristics in suicide-related broadcast media content, including characteristics we estimated to be simpler and more difficult, as well as multi-class characteristics. This adds to earlier work that demonstrated the efficiency of machine learning in classifying social media content [11] and relevance for prevention [26]. In the current study, both the word frequency based representation Tf-idf with a linear SVM classifier as well as the deep learning model BERT were clearly better than the naive majority classifier across all tasks. However, neither BERT nor Tf-idf with SVM were clearly better than the other model. Both models also achieved similar performance in the test and validation set for almost all tasks, suggesting they generalized well to new data not seen during training.",A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media
362,"Can you provide more detail on how the deep learning model, particularly BERT, was advantageous in classifying texts with complex main focus topics like Policy and Advocacy?","Finally, classifying the main focus of the item was the task with the most classes and the most severe class imbalances. Many categories had too few example transcripts to allow interpretation of their performance scores. Of more frequent categories, transcripts focusing on murder suicides were classified quite well (BERT F1�= .8, Tf-idf with SVM F1�= .83), with Tf-idf with SVM being better for precision, possibly because a few keywords (e.g., ?homicide?) were sufficient to label these correctly. Reporting focusing on suicide death was classified similarly well (BERT F1�= .76, Tf-idf with SVM F1�= .67), with BERT being better at detecting many cases. This result demonstrates that at least well-defined main foci of a text, with sufficient training examples, can be classified reliably. For broader main focus topics like Policy, performance was very similar, but only with BERT (F1�= .76, Tf-idf with SVM F1�= .62). For such more complex topics, the deep learning model might provide an advantage. Finally, a main focus on Advocacy was also classified moderately well (BERT F1�= .72, Tf-idf with SVM F1�= 0.67), with similar precision and recall. In general, class imbalances as seen here are a common issue in suicide prevention, as texts featuring each characteristic are much rarer than texts without the charateristic. We tested the effect of data augmentation techniques for some of the classification tasks.33�The augmentation techniques did not consistently improve or otherwise change the performance scores on any of the classification tasks, suggesting that artificially augmenting rare data categories did not improve the performance of our models.33",A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media
363,"Can you explain how the use of indicative keywords plays a role in accurately identifying the positive outcome of a suicidal crisis, despite the small number of positive cases in the training data?","Exceptions from the tight sample-size performance correlation may indicate which aspects of a characteristic or model additionally influence performance. A first set of exceptions are tasks which can likely be solved with a few indicative keywords, including celebrity suicides (attempted, assisted and murder suicide). Possibly, the high precision (>.80) of both models for the positive outcome of a suicidal crisis, despite the small number of positive cases to train on (n = 118), could also be explained by indicative keywords accurately identifying this characteristic.",A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media
364,Can you explain how sample size affects the performance of multi-class tasks in the context of analyzing broadcast items and transcripts mentioning suicide deaths?,"Fig 4�also reveals that sample size determines performance of multi-class tasks: Problem focus of broadcast items (cyan dot) has very similar sample sizes and performance scores as transcripts mentioning suicide deaths, although this task had four rather than two classes. Solution-focus performance (yellow dot) is much lower, as is the sample size of this class. Regarding class sizes below 250, it is interesting to note outliers with very high performance despite very low sample size: The upper left corner of some of the four panels in�Fig 4�features some of the violet dots, indicating the main focus categories Assisted suicide, Murder suicide, Attempted suicide. All of these may be explained by highly indicative keywords, like ?attempt?, ?euthanasia? or ?murder?, and?homicide?. Finally, outliers in the left bottom corner of panels, include the main focus categories Suicidal ideation and Other. With a class size of n = 2 in the test set for the first, and n = 19 for the second, these scores cannot be interpreted. The same applies for the category ?Neither [problem or solution focus]?

365,"Can you provide more information on why predicting the less frequent presence of a characteristic (the positive class) was more difficult for both the BERT and Tf-idf with SVM models, despite their high performance scores for predicting the absence of a characteristic (precision for negative class) or detecting texts without the characteristic (recall for negative class)?","For most binary classification tasks (Fig 3A), both BERT and Tf-idf with SVM achieved very high performance scores (above .90) when predicting that a transcript did not contain a characteristic (precision for negative class) or detecting texts without the characteristic (recall for negative class). Predicting the less frequent presence of a characteristic (the positive class) was usually more difficult for both models (often between .50 and .60). Transcripts without the characteristic were the majority class by a large margin, except for suicide deaths, where texts mentioning a suicide were more frequent (see�Fig 1A). Suicide death was also one of the two classification tasks where performance was similar for both classes (negative class: >.75, positive class: >.82). The only other such binary tasks is celebrity suicide, where models can achieve high performance by learning only the names of celebrities who died by suicide from April 1 2019 to March 30 2020, and thus do not require as many training examples.",A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media

369,"Could you explain why different layers of the BERT model are fine-tuned with different decaying learning rates, and how this approach affects the model's performance in capturing semantic and syntactic information?","We fine-tuned the BERT-base-uncased model by adding a dense output layer that reduces the dimensions of the last layer to the number of labels per classification task, training all parameters simultaneously [24]. The different layers of BERT can capture different levels of semantic and syntactic information, with lower layers probably containing more general information. Therefore, we fine-tuned the layers with different decaying learning rates, following the approach of Howard and Ruder (2018) [25]. To find the maximal learning rate that is associated with a still-falling loss, that is, residuals (prior to the loss diverging), we ran a hyperparameter search.�S1 Fig�shows that learning rates up to 10e-5 are still associated with falling losses. We report results for BERT with a LR = 1e-5 and text length of 512, for the epoch with best results on the validation set out of maximally 12 epochs (this was usually around epoch 4?7).",A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media

374,"Can you provide more details on how BERT's performance for determining the main focus of a transcript remained stable when generalizing to new data in the test set, despite lower performance in the validation set?","Across all tasks, performance was comparable across the test and validation set, indicating that both models generalized well to new data (see�S5 Table�and�S1 Fig). For most classification tasks, scores in the two datasets were very similar. When generalizing to the test set, Tf-idf with SVM performance was lowest in the most complex task, determining the main focus of a transcript, achieving .60 instead of .70 for all metrics. BERT?s performance for main focus, although lower in the validation set, remained stable when generalizing to new data in the test set, showing that it learnt generalizable features even when training on multiple categories with few training samples for each. Interestingly, the precision of both models was also by .1 points lower in the validation set for healing stories, but recall was less affected (especially for BERT). This may indicate that healing stories in the training set were not yet representative of the different ways in which stories of healing and coping are described in broadcast media.

375,"Can you provide more information on the performance scores of AI models trained on transcripts focusing on suicide deaths, advocacy, murder-suicide, legal issues, and policy?","Regarding the main focus of transcripts (Fig 1C), items focusing on suicide deaths were clearly the most frequent (25%). Advocacy (11%), murder-suicide (9.6%), and policy (11.9%) were also among the more frequent focus areas, while healing stories (3%), or suicidal thoughts (0.5%), were rarely the major focus. Given these low percentages, considering the absolute number of examples that models were trained on is crucial before interpreting performance scores. The median number and range of broadcast items for a particular main focus was 89 (min 8, max 381) in the training set, and 27.5 (min 2, max 121) in the test set. The most rarely mentioned main focus areas definitely have too few transcripts in the test set to allow a conclusion about their performance scores. These include assisted suicide (n = 10), suicide clusters (n = 7), healing stories (n = 14), and suicidal ideation (n = 2). Another group of main foci (attempted suicide, mass murder, prevention, research) had below 30 items in the test set, and should be interpreted only with great caution.

391,Can you provide more details on how the machine learning approach was developed using the transcripts from the previous media evaluation project?,"We retrieved a total of 2519 transcripts of media items for Oregon and Washington for April 1 2019 to March 30 2020 from the media screening company Infomart/Brandwatch. Only items with a ""major focus"" on suicide / suicidal ideation / suicide prevention, defined as more than just a short paragraph about the topic, were included. Other items were excluded by Infomart, similar to the approach used in previous related research [13]. The focus on the geographical regions of Oregon and Washington was taken because this study built up on a media evaluation project that included specifically media items from these two states [14]. We reused the transcripts from this previous project to develop the machine learning approach in this study. The dataset was derived from 44 broadcast sources across both states (see [14] and�S1 Table�for details about sources covered). We received full transcripts of broadcast media items in pdf format.",A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media
392,Can you provide more information on the machine learning studies that categorized Twitter posts into different content types related to suicide prevention and awareness campaigns?,"With regard to broadcast media content, machine learning approaches to categorize content are largely missing. This is in spite of the fact that particularly news media reporting has frequently been found to be associated with suicide [5], and although global efforts to reduce imitation suicide using media recommendations for safe portrayals have largely focused on news media [3]. In contrast, some research has been done on social media content. Specifically, there are now three machine learning studies that categorized Twitter posts into frequent content types, including celebrity suicide posts, posts signaling suicidal ident, awareness campaigns, prevention information, condolences and flippant remarks [10,�11]. These studies have typically used word frequency statistics as predefined features for model training. However, the meaning of words also depends on their context, and more novel deep learning models [see e.g.,�11,�12] are needed to take context better into account.",A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media
393,Could you provide more examples of content characteristics that have been deemed potentially harmful or protective in suicide-related reporting?,"In order to mitigate the risks associated with suicide-related reporting in broadcast and online media, media recommendations for the reporting on suicide have been developed by national and international public health organizations [3]. These recommendations list content characteristics that have been deemed as potentially harmful and protective. On the one hand, recommendations include suggestions such as not focusing on suicide death; but rather on suicidal ideation in prevention-reporting. Further, they discourage extensive reporting on celebrity death from suicide, and recommend not to perpetuate common public misconceptions and myths about suicide. On the other hand, media recommendations also encourage reporting characteristics that might be helpful to vulnerable audiences. Specifically, they encourage the reporting of alternatives to suicidal behaviour, reporting of healing stories (i.e., stories of individuals who managed to recover from suicidal thoughts), and the reporting of positive outcome of crisis. Although not all of the specific recommendations have solid empirical evidence (many of them are based on expert consensus), current media recommendations are considered to be the most available and practical tool to help prevent suicide from suicide-related media reporting [3].",A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media
394,"How did the machine learning models, such as Tf-idf with SVM and BERT, perform when classifying suicide-related broadcast media content in terms of identifying the main focus of a text from 14 categories?","Suicide-related media content has preventive or harmful effects depending on the specific content. Proactive media screening for suicide prevention is hampered by the scarcity of machine learning approaches to detect specific characteristics in news reports. This study applied machine learning to label large quantities of broadcast (TV and radio) media data according to media recommendations reporting suicide. We manually labeled 2519 English transcripts from 44 broadcast sources in Oregon and Washington, USA, published between April 2019 and March 2020. We conducted a content analysis of media reports regarding content characteristics. We trained a benchmark of machine learning models including a majority classifier, approaches based on word frequency (TF-IDF with a linear SVM) and a deep learning model (BERT). We applied these models to a selection of more simple (e.g., focus on a suicide death), and subsequently to putatively more complex tasks (e.g., determining the main focus of a text from 14 categories). Tf-idf with SVM and BERT were clearly better than the naive majority classifier for all characteristics. In a test dataset not used during model training, F1-scores (i.e., the harmonic mean of precision and recall) ranged from 0.90 for celebrity suicide down to 0.58 for the identification of the main focus of the media item. Model performance depended strongly on the number of training samples available, and much less on assumed difficulty of the classification task. This study demonstrates that machine learning models can achieve very satisfactory results for classifying suicide-related broadcast media content, including multi-class characteristics, as long as enough training samples are available. The developed models enable future large-scale screening and investigations of broadcast media.",A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suicide-related content in broadcast media
395,What specific challenges do the variability in individual responses to exercise pose for developing AI-driven interventions for mental health disorders?,"While our research has yielded encouraging outcomes, it is not without limitations. The complexity of mental health disorders and the variability in individual responses to exercise highlight the challenges in developing universally effective AI-driven interventions. Additionally, the reliance on self-reported data in some of our assessments could introduce bias or inaccuracies.

396,How does the AI system cater to the distinct needs of each participant and maximize potential for adherence?,"This level of individualization in exercise prescription is pivotal (49). It recognizes the complex interplay between mental health and physical activity, allowing for adjustments based on factors such as an individual?s specific mental health condition, their physical fitness levels, and their daily routines and preferences. For instance, someone with mild depression might benefit from a different type and intensity of exercise compared to someone with severe anxiety. Likewise, a physically active individual might be prescribed a more vigorous regimen than someone who is less active. By tailoring exercise recommendations in this way, our AI system not only caters to the distinct needs of each participant but also maximizes the potential for adherence. Adherence is often a significant challenge in traditional exercise regimes, but by offering personalized and therefore more relevant and engaging exercise plans, our system could significantly improve compliance rates (50).",Evaluating machine learning-enabled and multimodal data-driven exercise prescriptions for mental health: a randomized controlled trial protocol

402,How does the AI model determine the most suitable type of exercise for each individual in the intervention group?,"The 25 participants in the intervention group receive personalized exercise prescriptions generated by our AI model. These prescriptions are meticulously tailored based on each participant?s health profile and mental health status. The AI model determines the most suitable Type of Exercise for each individual, ranging from aerobic activities to strength training, depending on their physical and mental health needs. The Frequency of exercise is set, aiming for a balance that maximizes benefit while considering each individual?s lifestyle and capacity. Intensity levels are also customized, ensuring that exercises are challenging yet safe and achievable for each participant. Lastly, the Duration of each exercise session is specified by the AI model, optimizing the time spent on each activity for maximum efficacy. For example, for a participant with moderate depression and a sedentary lifestyle, the AI model might prescribe light aerobic activities like brisk walking or cycling for 30?min, three times a week. The intensity would be set at a moderate level, ensuring the participant can comfortably sustain the activity while gaining mental health benefits. The model may also suggest gentle yoga twice a week to improve flexibility and reduce stress, tailoring the duration to 20?min per session to match the participant?s initial physical fitness level. The intervention lasts for a period of 4?weeks, during which participants adhere to their personalized exercise regimen. The control group, comprising another set of 25 participants, receives standard care practices. This generally includes generic health advice and non-tailored exercise recommendations, reflecting the conventional approach to mental health management.

411,Can you provide more specific examples of how AI-driven tools are used in mental health to predict patient outcomes and personalize treatment plans?,"The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare and medicine has marked a transformative era, particularly with the advancements in deep learning algorithms and the enhanced capabilities in processing large volumes of data (16,�17). These technological leaps have enabled the deployment of AI across various medical fields, including mental health, internal medicine, infectious disease control, heart failure management, and diabetes care, among others. Specifically in the domain of mental health (18), AI-driven tools are being used to predict patient outcomes, personalize treatment plans, and even assist in early diagnosis through pattern recognition in patient data. In internal medicine (19), AI algorithms contribute to diagnostic accuracy and patient management, while in the field of infectious diseases control (20), AI plays a pivotal role in outbreak prediction, tracking, and formulating response strategies. The application of AI is equally significant in managing chronic diseases. For instance, in heart failure (21,�22), AI assists in patient monitoring, risk assessment, and tailoring treatment regimes. Similarly, in diabetes management (23), AI technologies are employed for continuous glucose monitoring and predicting episodes of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, thereby enhancing patient care. In the context of China?s medical resource constraints, the development of AI-based prescription recommendation systems is particularly promising (24). These systems have the potential to mitigate the gap in healthcare delivery, offering efficient, accurate, and accessible medical advice. A notable example of such innovation is the reinforcement learning-based dynamic prescription recommendation system proposed by Wang and colleagues (25). This system exemplifies the application of AI in optimizing treatment plans, adapting to patient-specific needs and changes over time (26).",Evaluating machine learning-enabled and multimodal data-driven exercise prescriptions for mental health: a randomized controlled trial protocol

440,How have recent advances in patient data ownership and access potentially increased the likelihood of patients having access to predictive AI output?,"Due to the gap between the predictive AI?s accuracy and its lack of observed impact on health outcomes, many researchers in many countries have studied health professionals? perceptions of AI-based tools and related implementation challenges [16,23-28]. However, patients? perspectives of AI have been understudied [29-31]. While some predictive AI developers may not intend for patients to view the AI?s output on their own, it has become more likely that patients have access to predictive AI output due to recent advances in patient data ownership and access. The US 21st Century Cures Act, for example, prevents blocking information from patients, requiring health organizations and insurance providers to give patients access to their eHealth information without delay or expense [32]. This may result in a patient seeing a predictive AI risk score before a discussion with their health care team. In a 2020 predictive AI preimplementation study, health professionals stressed the importance of keeping the patient in the information loop when the AI predicts a risk or recommends a treatment to justify to the patient why they may require further support [24]. In addition to practical considerations, there is an ethical imperative to ensure patients understand how their data are being used, what predictive AI may reveal, and what the insight means, especially for sensitive issues, such as mental health care concerns [33]. Before we design solutions for communicating AI information to patients, it is important to understand the public?s perceived benefits, comfort, concerns, and values related to AI use, particularly for mental health care [34].",Patient Perspectives on AI for Mental Health Care: Cross-Sectional Survey Study

470,"Can you provide an example of how individual characteristics may impact the risk of an individual having MDD, even if they are part of a reference group with a certain frequency of MDD?","There is a fundamental issue about the validity of this kind of inference from the frequency of, say, MDD in a reference group to the risk that an individual member of the reference group has MDD (24). There can easily be features of the individual member which make her much more or much less likely to have MDD than the probability that a randomly drawn member of the reference group suffers MDD. To bring this out, one could require that this was made explicit in the way the algorithm presented its finding: Patient A belongs to a group of patients of which n/100 are positive for MDD.",Ethical trade-offs in AI for mental health

The sort of inference that the algorithm in effect makes when it assigns a risk score to a patient is the following:,Ethical trade-offs in AI for mental health
473,Can you elaborate on why explainability is important in decision-making in psychiatry when using algorithms to predict MDD?,The development of an algorithm for predicting MDD thus involves an important tradeoff between the improvement of accuracy that may be achieved by a highly complex algorithm versus the possibility that humans can understand why the algorithm generated a particular output from an input. In the context of decision-making in psychiatry explainability would seem to be of great importance to ensure that algorithmic outputs can be trusted and acted upon.�2,Ethical trade-offs in AI for mental health
474,"How do researchers aim to address the complexity of ""black box"" algorithms and make predictive ML algorithms more understandable for users, especially in the context of healthcare and patient data?","The main selling point of predictive ML algorithms is their comparatively high accuracy. The most accurate types of algorithms are often described as ?black boxes.? This characterization aims to convey the fact that deep neural networks and other types of highly accurate ML algorithms are too complex for humans to be able to explain how they arrive at an output from an input. In response to the black box nature of algorithms, research on ?Explainable AI? or XAI has surfaced with researchers trying to develop tools that may help users understand why an individual prediction was produced based on an input from a patient.",Ethical trade-offs in AI for mental health
475,Can you provide examples of the tradeoffs that need to be made when considering algorithmic fairness in the context of predicting mental health conditions like MDD?,"A wide range of algorithmic fairness definitions has been explored in detail since Angwin et�al. (18). A key upshot of this literature is that there are several plausible candidates for algorithmic fairness and that, as a matter of mathematics, not all plausible candidate definitions of algorithmic fairness can be met simultaneously in ordinary circumstances (e.g.,�19,�20). Tradeoffs must be made. To see this consider a situation in which one wants the MDD algorithm to have the same sensitivity and specificity (or true positive and true negative rate) for men and women. The ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of predictions about patients who in fact have MDD should be the same for male and female patients. And the ratio of true negative predictions about patients who are in fact negative for MDD should be the same for men and women. In ordinary circumstances, the frequency of MDD will differ for the male and female population. However, if this is the case, then achieving equal sensitivity and specificity can only be achieved if some men and women, who are estimated to have the same probability of suffering MDD, do not receive the same prediction. This is because to achieve equal sensitivity and specificity, the algorithm will have to apply different classification thresholds to men and women.",Ethical trade-offs in AI for mental health
476,Can you provide examples of how skewed datasets can lead to bias and fairness issues in AI algorithms used in mental health applications?,"Problems of bias and fairness may arise for several reasons. Some important ones include skewed datasets used for training and testing (16), choice of proxy variable (17), and the use context of the algorithm, e.g., on a population that differs from the population represented in the training and testing data.",Ethical trade-offs in AI for mental health
477,Can you elaborate on how prioritizing acquiring more data about men would ensure almost equal accuracy rates for both men and women when developing algorithms for mental health purposes?,"And what sort of considerations would support one or the other decision? Perhaps the overall accuracy of the algorithm will be higher by allowing for an imbalance with respect to men and women. However, the comparative improvement of accuracy would be due to improvement for women. Prioritizing acquiring more data about men would on the other hand not achieve as high overall accuracy. However, it would ensure that the algorithm achieved almost equal accuracy rates for men and women.",Ethical trade-offs in AI for mental health
478,One question that I would like elaboration on is: How do value judgments play a role in determining what data is included in a training dataset for predicting MDD using algorithms?,"The quality of an algorithm for predicting MDD is dependent on the data available for training. This is because the training dataset provides the algorithm with a representation of the world in which it is going to be used ? the world according to the data (14). Thus, the choice of training data is a choice about what representation of reality the algorithm is going to learn from. Notably, the way a training dataset is compiled will reflect value judgments, judgments about what makes the dataset good (enough) for the purpose of training the algorithm to predict the outcome of interest. Thus, ?the data,? do not provide a representation of reality which is independent of human values and interests. When it comes to determining what to include in a training dataset several value-laden considerations will come into play.",Ethical trade-offs in AI for mental health
479,How does goal setting play a role in determining whether investing in algorithmic prediction is the best way to achieve a particular outcome in the context of mental health advancements through AI?,"A decision to look to a predictive algorithm will rely on some goal or other, which provides the initial justification for investing in algorithmic prediction. The way the goal is stated determines the alternative courses of action and investment that will be competing with the algorithmic solution. Goal setting is clearly a value-laden activity. The goal one chooses to pursue expresses a notion about what one takes to be valuable states of affairs. Moreover, there might well be disagreement about whether a goal is indeed worth pursuing, and even if there is agreement about the goal, there might be disagreement about whether investing in an algorithmic approach is the best way to achieve the goal.",Ethical trade-offs in AI for mental health
480,How can the use of predictive algorithms in mental health care be beneficial in improving patient outcomes and treatment strategies?,"While these are some of the ways in which algorithmic support may improve on current methods, the choice to deploy an algorithm to classify patients with respect to some outcome does not take place in a vacuum. Opting for deploying a predictive algorithm will be guided by some goal that is assumed to be best achieved by better prediction. Thus, the first decision point concerns the identification and characterization of the goal of using the algorithm. What sort of problem is the algorithm supposed to help solve?",Ethical trade-offs in AI for mental health

482,"How do value assumptions play a role in the development and implementation of predictive algorithms in psychiatry, and how can awareness of these assumptions help facilitate discussions between patients and psychiatrists?",In this article I characterize these tradeoffs so that patients and psychiatrists are not lured into thinking that ML algorithms simply reflect the facts independently of any value-laden decisions. Hopefully the framework outlined may facilitate clarification and discussion of the value assumptions informing predictive algorithms which are candidates for being used in psychiatry.,Ethical trade-offs in AI for mental health
483,"As a student fascinated by the implications of advancements in AI on mental health, I would like to know how the presence of human biases can impact the outcomes of machine learning algorithms in the context of mental health prediction and treatment.","However, one must be careful when describing ML algorithms as objective. An algorithm may be said to be more objective than a clinician in the sense that training and test datasets, algorithm type, performance, and other factors can be made public for all to see. Still, characterizing an algorithm as objective signals that the algorithm?s output is not influenced by human values and biases. Being data-driven, the algorithm may be thought to simply look at the facts, derive a predictive pattern, and produce a prediction with no room for human bias to creep into the process. In fact, studies show that 40 percent of Americans consider it possible to produce algorithms which are objective in the sense of being free from human biases (12). In other words, there is a strong association between algorithmic predictions and value-neutrality. Algorithmic outputs are not influenced by human values. They just consider the facts and produce their predictions.",Ethical trade-offs in AI for mental health
484,Can you provide specific examples or studies that demonstrate the high predictive accuracy of machine learning algorithms in medicine and psychiatry when compared to clinical methods?,"The comparatively high predictive accuracy of algorithms has been recognized for more than half a century. In 1954 Meehl (8) argued that statistical reasoning should play a more dominant role in clinical decision-making. In 1970 Sines (9) reviewed studies comparing statistical/actuarial and clinical methods for making predictions in psychopathology and concluded that ?the actuarial predictions were found to exceed or at least equal the accuracy of clinical predictions? (9, 142). Dawes et�al. (10) reconfirms this conclusion.

A central argument for deploying algorithmic methods in clinical decision-making in psychiatry is that they may enable not only faster and more accurate clinical judgments but also that they may provide a more objective foundation for clinical decisions. This article argues that the outputs of algorithms are never objective in the sense of being unaffected by human values and possibly biased choices. And it suggests that the best way to approach this is to ensure awareness of and transparency about the ethical trade-offs that must be made when developing an algorithm for mental health.",Ethical trade-offs in AI for mental health

488,What are some potential challenges or risks associated with ensuring the security and robustness of ML and DL models in the context of brain disorder detection and diagnosis that are highlighted in the text?,"The security and robustness of the ML and DL-based models are also crucial considerations [77-79]. Many ML and DL models published in the literature have only been tested on a single dataset. As a result, it's unknown if the ML and DL models can be applied to input data from multiple scanning devices. As a result, it would be useful to examine how the ML and DL models should be developed to ensure portability. It may also make sense in this context to assess ML and DL models using several datasets supplied by various sensors or manufacturers. As previously said, ML and DL systems need a significant quantity of data to learn and construct solid models. When it comes to data, it is also critical to ensure the credibility, dependability, and security of the sources or platforms from which the data is derived. If malicious actors are successful in altering or modifying the data used as input for the ML and DL system, the outcome of the ML and DL system may be affected. As a result, these results are no longer dependable and may harm the patient's health due to the risk of incorrect outcomes. Data storage is particularly crucial since medical data is subject to strict data-protection requirements [80-82]. As a result, whether storage options have complied with legislation and how to ensure that data is not traceable should be investigated. Future studies should investigate if data masking is adequate or whether total anonymization is necessary in this circumstance. Various academics are also investigating whether emerging technologies for distributed data storage and administration, such as blockchain, are suitable for medical data. A future study might thus examine whether a blockchain makes sense for the goal of organizing and preserving medical data, or whether alternative technologies and databases are more appropriate. Furthermore, it is worth noting that there are currently a few research available that look into the security and resilience of ML and DL models for brain disorder detection and diagnosis. External validation of ML and DL algorithms and robustness testing against adversarial pictures, as well as rigorous data pre-treatment, are potential approaches for achieving robustness and security goals and should thus be researched further. In this context, design science research might be used to iteratively address specific security issues to identify an efficient solution.",Brain Disorder Detection and Diagnosis using Machine Learning and Deep Learning - A Bibliometric Analysis

551,Can you provide more information on how the eXGBM model was determined to be the optimal model for predicting severe mental distress based on the comprehensive evaluation scoring system?,"Among the developed models, the eXGBM model exhibited the highest AUC value of 0.932 (95% CI: 0.911?0.949), closely followed by the RF model with an AUC of 0.927 (95% CI: 0.905?0.943) (Fig.�2). The calibration curve demonstrated that most models, particularly eXGBM, RF, and KNN, displayed favorable calibration ability (Fig.�3). Further assessment of the calibration slope and intercept-in-large confirmed the good calibration of these models, with calibration slopes close to 1 and intercept-in-large values close to 0 (Supplementary Fig.�1). The probability density curve revealed the ability of the eXGBM, RF, and KNN models to effectively distinguish participants with and without severe mental distress. This was indicated by the leftward shift of the peak of the blue curve (participants without severe mental distress) and the rightward shift of the peak of the red curve (participants with severe mental distress) (Fig.�4). Violin plots supported this trend, with the eXGBM model exhibiting the highest discrimination slope (0.598), followed by the KNN model (0.594) and the RF model (0.553) (Fig.�5). In terms of performance measures, the eXGBM model demonstrated superior accuracy (0.850), precision (0.824), recall (0.890), specificity (0.810), F1 score (0.856), Brier score (0.103), and log loss (0.326) (Fig.�6; Table�2).

556,Can you explain further how the discrimination slope and calibration slope are calculated and how they help in evaluating a model's performance in ranking high-risk and low-risk individuals and in aligning predicted probabilities with observed probabilities?,"In addition to log loss, we utilized the discrimination slope to assess the model?s ability to rank individuals based on their predicted probabilities. The discrimination slope measures how well the model distinguishes between high-risk and low-risk individuals [11,�28]. The calibration slope, on the other hand, evaluates the alignment between the model?s predicted probabilities and the observed probabilities. A calibration slope value of 1 indicates perfect calibration. Both the calibration slope and the intercept-in-large were obtained from the calibration curve, which provides insights into the model?s calibration performance.","An artificial intelligence tool to assess the risk of severe mental distress among college students in terms of demographics, eating habits, lifestyles, and sport habits: an externally validated study using machine learning"

559,Can you explain in more detail how the hyperparameter tuning process was designed to balance complexity and generalization in the machine learning models for predicting severe mental distress in university students?,"In this study, a wide range of machine learning techniques were employed for modeling purposes. These techniques included logistic regression (LR), extreme gradient boosting machine (eXGBM), decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM). All models were trained and optimized using the same input features identified through subgroup analysis of university students with and without severe mental distress. The process of hyperparameter tuning for our machine learning models was meticulously designed to ensure optimal performance while maintaining a balance between complexity and generalization. Initially, we established wide ranges for each hyperparameter, informed by extensive literature reviews and empirical evidence [27]. This approach enabled a thorough exploration of potential values. For instance, we set the depth of decision trees to range from 2 to 100. To navigate these ranges, we employed a combination of grid search and random search techniques; grid search was used for smaller, discrete hyperparameter sets, while random search covered larger, continuous ranges. The performance of each model configuration was rigorously evaluated using k-fold cross-validation, typically with k set to 5 or 10, depending on the dataset?s size. By employing this approach, we ensured the selection of well-performing models while avoiding both underfitting and overfitting. The machine learning algorithms were implemented using Python (version 3.9.7), and hyperparameter tuning was conducted using scikit-learn (version 1.2.2).","An artificial intelligence tool to assess the risk of severe mental distress among college students in terms of demographics, eating habits, lifestyles, and sport habits: an externally validated study using machine learning"
560,Can you provide more information on how the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scales were pre-validated in Chinese populations?,"The severity of anxiety was evaluated with the general anxiety disorder-7 (GAD-7), and the severity of depression was evaluated with the patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The GAD-7 and PHQ-9 are widely used self-report questionnaires [21,�22]. Both scales consist of several items that are scored on a scale from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity. A score of 15 or above was regarded as severe anxiety or depression in both scales. They were valuable tools for screening, diagnosing, and monitoring anxiety and depression in individuals. The reliability of GAD-7 and PHQ-9 was pre-validated in Chinese populations [23,�24].

The survey included questions about participants? basic demographics, exercise and eating habits, lifestyle, sleep quality, and mental health status [17]. The questionnaire was presented in Chinese, and the same language versions questionnaires applied uniformly on all participants. The questionnaire was distributed online at these various universities. Participants were excluded if they had a previous diagnosis of anxiety or depression, or were unwilling to participate. All participants were randomly divided into a training group and a validation group in an 8:2 ratio. The training group was used to develop models, while the validation group was used to test the models internally. External validation was conducted on 751 participants from three universities between May and June 2023. The survey distributed was identical to the one used for model development, ensuring consistency in the data collection process. Notably, the online survey was anonymous and did not collect any personal information. See Fig.�1�for a visual representation of the study design. The study was approved by the Academic Committee and Ethics Board of the Xiamen University of Technology, and all participants provided informed consent. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and reported following the TRIPOD Checklist [18].","An artificial intelligence tool to assess the risk of severe mental distress among college students in terms of demographics, eating habits, lifestyles, and sport habits: an externally validated study using machine learning"
562,Can you provide examples of the types of data that AI algorithms can process to develop predictive models for mental health issues among college students?,"Accurately predicting the likelihood of mental issues among college students is crucial for early intervention and prevention [7?9]. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning techniques have shown great promise in the field of mental health [7?9]. These technologies have the potential to revolutionize the prediction and prevention of mental health among college students. AI algorithms can process large amounts of data [10], including demographic information, lifestyle factors, and psychological parameters, to develop predictive models with high accuracy and reliability. Additionally, AI tools can provide personalized risk assessments and recommendations, facilitating targeted interventions and support [10?13]. Several studies have explored the use of AI in predicting mental health problems among college students [14?16]. These studies have shown favorable results, with AI algorithms achieving relatively high levels of accuracy in identifying individuals at high risk for mental issues, such as negative mental well-being traits, mental health problems, severe depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and perceived stress [7?9,�14?16]. However, there have been no specific AI models reported for predicting severe mental distress currently.","An artificial intelligence tool to assess the risk of severe mental distress among college students in terms of demographics, eating habits, lifestyles, and sport habits: an externally validated study using machine learning"

This study aimed to develop and validate an advanced AI tool for predicting the likelihood of severe mental distress in college students.","An artificial intelligence tool to assess the risk of severe mental distress among college students in terms of demographics, eating habits, lifestyles, and sport habits: an externally validated study using machine learning"
566,"How do Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) and Evidence-Based Strategic Communication (EBSC) contribute to the recovery of mental health in war-affected societies, and how can AI advancements enhance the effectiveness of these approaches?","The power of simultaneous usage of CCBT and EBSC supported by tools and means of AI may provide a breakthrough in global mental health recovery in war-inflicted societies after the enormous psychological distress caused by war brutality and tragedies. The synergy between individual psycho-therapeutic techniques, such as Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET), and psychological operations on a strategic level, based on EBSC can be understood by their common neurobiological underpinnings (Wiederhold and Wiederhold, 2008;�?osi? et al., 2012a,b). The potential of AI-based tools and means, such as machine learning, deep learning, neuro-linguistic programming, cloud infrastructure, and new wearable therapeutic devices and apps offer an immense prospect to enhance mental health care on a global scale, rendering them more economically viable and readily implementable. Specifically, when considering the insufficiency of psychiatrists and the limited availability of psychiatric resources in addressing war traumas, disasters, and tragedies, the suggested approach may prove to be a transformative force in the field of psychiatry in the years to come.","War, emotions, mental health, and artificial intelligence"
567,How do Chat GPT and Google Gemini contribute to reshaping dominant emotional maps in targeted populations and protecting human mental health in war-torn societies?,"AI-based tools that can be applied in the creation of EBSC stimuli, like Chat GPT or Google Gemini (Alford, 2024), may have great potential to significantly enhance EBSC by deeper understanding of the dominant emotional maps in targeted populations by more comprehensive semantic and linguistic analyses of available text datasets (Elyoseph et al., 2023). Chat GPT and Gemini can aid in crafting emotional messages that resonate among the targeted populations, amplifying the impact of strategic communications and reshaping dominant emotional maps over time into more positive ones, simultaneously protecting human mental health in war torn societies. It is important to stress that Gemini has an advantage over Chat GPT in EBSC providing high-quality information extracted in real-time, having been trained from Gmail, Google Docs, Google Maps, and Google Drive accounts instead of books and articles to ensure more up-to-date information. However, before one can fully rely on these AI tools, the applied LLM must provide high accuracy, transparency, and trust. Off-the-shelf models such as ChatGPT 4 or Gemini can produce wrong answers which is unacceptable in any kind of public campaigning, therefore human experts must be permanently embedded in the EBSC closed loop. To be applicable, understandable, and explainable within a specific war zone or region, LLM should be trained on a relevant dataset, for example, using Ukraine or Gaza posts related to current security environment and war disasters.","War, emotions, mental health, and artificial intelligence"
568,How can emotionally based strategic communications be used in conflict and post-conflict management within diverse social and cultural contexts to protect mental health of local populations in war-inflicted societies?,"Transformation of dominant emotional maps might be undertaken by simultaneous combination of computerized CBT (CCBT) on an individual level, as well as usage of emotionally based strategic communications (EBSC) on a public level. Strategic communications, aimed at shaping perceptions and behavior, can be enhanced by leveraging emotions, as proposed in EBSC (?osi? et al., 2012a,b). This aligns with J. A. Treadwell?s statement: ?If you want to influence someone, you have to touch their emotions? (Merle, 2005). Emotionally infused strategies, whether in individual therapy like CCBT or in strategic communications like EBSC, are essential for effective intervention. Integrating emotional strategies into strategic communications can be pivotal in conflict and post-conflict management within diverse social and cultural contexts. Hence, the proposed positive emotional transformation by means of CBT and EBSC may provide important leverage in efforts to protect mental health of local populations in war-inflicted societies. The transformation of negative dominant emotional maps into more positive emotions delivered by EBSC messages to targeted audiences is focused on mental health protection and support. This type of psychological operation can be defined as ?planned psychological activities using methods of communications and other means directed to selected audiences in order to shape their perceptions, attitudes and behavior to achieve specific political and military objectives? (Reding et al., 2010). Strategic communication can be defined as ?a systematic series of sustained and coherent activities, conducted across strategic, operational and tactical levels to promote and sustain particular types of ideas, opinions and behavior? (Tatham, 2008).","War, emotions, mental health, and artificial intelligence"
569,"As a student interested in the intersection of AI and mental health, I would like to know more about how acoustic characteristics of speech, such as prosody and certain features like fundamental frequency and pauses, can be utilized in emotional analysis of speech in relation to mental health.","Acoustic characteristics of speech, like prosody have commonly been utilized as indicators of sentiments, emotions and underlying physiological states (Huang et al., 2021). Slight alterations in physiological and cognitive states can result in perceptible acoustic alterations in speech perception, particularly during distressing incidents (Scherer, 1984). Certain descriptions can be readily elucidated by individual characteristics such as reduced fundamental frequency of speech, decreased number of voiced frames in an utterance, and pauses between words. Additional set of acoustic features that delineate such phenomena contributes to more information in the emotional analysis of speech (?osi? et al., 2021).","War, emotions, mental health, and artificial intelligence"
570,How do wearable physiological sensors play a role in monitoring and tracking human behavior to prevent serious mental health disorders in war-inflicted societies?,"Today, each part of human biology can be captured by more than a thousand sensors collecting a few thousand physiological, emotional, cognitive and behavioral features (Dang et al., 2023). Wearable physiological sensors may include measurements of heart rate variability, body temperature, breathing dynamics, oculometric features, electrodermal activity, respiration rate, blood volume, blood oxygen saturation, blood pressure, acoustic recordings, movement sensors, such as tri-axis accelerometers, tri-axis gyroscopes, inertial platforms, magnetometers, and many others (Ates et al., 2022;�Scataglini et al., 2023). From all these neuro-psycho-physiological variables, more complex physiological states can be computed (i.e., respiratory sinus arrythmia). Daily tracking of activity and movement by GPS, their mutual interactions, and physiology or even metabolic functions, including variations of glucose, microbiome analysis, genomics sequencing, offers a new dimension in monitoring and tracking human behavior, and offers valuable tools and means in prevention of serious mental health disorders in war-inflicted societies.","War, emotions, mental health, and artificial intelligence"
571,Can you provide examples of how explainable AI could enhance the diagnostic process in psychiatry and improve therapeutic decision-making?,"Explainable AI within the field of psychiatry could potentially serve as a self-explanatory digital aid to psychiatrists, enabling them to meticulously analyze vast amounts of data and identify intricate patterns and concealed indicators that may elude the perception of a psychotherapist. The goal of XAI in mental health diagnostics is to understand explanatory factors of mental illness in order to improve diagnostic performance and empower therapeutic decision-making (Kerz et al., 2023). The interpretability of diagnostics and treatments is extremely important for guiding psychiatrists to understand not only what has been extracted from big multimodal datasets, but also to enhance treatment and prediction (Koppe et al., 2021). Machine and deep learning-based methods achieve good performance by utilizing a large number of features, their extraction and computation, but they still fail to explain some complex decisions (Zhang et al., 2022). As a result, the explainability or interpretability of the machine and deep learning decision making process will become an important research direction in the future. This is an issue when both patients and doctors need to understand why an outcome has been produced for a given specific set of multimodal inputs. This allows physicians to check if the reasoning of the trained model aligns with their own understanding and general medical domain principles. Understanding the mechanisms and rationales behind a particular machine learning algorithm is crucial in establishing confidence and trust among domain experts. These factors can lead human experts to either reject or embrace these diagnostic approaches. Therefore, the need for transparency in psychiatry due to probabilistic variations relating to the complexity of neuro-psycho-physiological factors of mental health disorders is extremely important. As increasingly complex models are developed and their replacements for human expert decision making, it is necessary to ensure that the ?black box? nature of these models have not learned undesirable patterns (Ali et al., 2023).","War, emotions, mental health, and artificial intelligence"
572,How do NLP techniques specifically analyze the linguistic features and information in free-form online posts to predict potential psychiatric disorders?,"The utilization of NLP and the analysis of free-form online posts can provide significant advantages in accurately predicting potential psychiatric disorders (Le Glaz et al., 2021;�Arowosegbe and Oyelade, 2023). In particular, distinguishing between individuals who are vulnerable to mental stress and those who are resilient to mental stress can greatly contribute to the reliability of such predictions (?osi? et al., 2021). NLP-based semantic analysis and recognition of specific keywords to track individual emotions and moods illustrates promising improvements to empower mental health management (Zhang et al., 2022). Such linguistic features and information and related unstructured data may be valuable tool in identification of relevant keywords for early detection of various mental health problems (?osi? et al., 2021). Early warning text-based indicators of potential mental illness deserve particular attention since they enable early intervention and prevention of serious mental health diseases, like PTSD. NLP methodologies possess the capability to apprehend irrational or distorted conversations that are related with some psychopathological patterns, such as the patient?s cognitive distortions, biases, core beliefs and negative wording. By employing NLP techniques, medical practitioners can unveil the configurations that exemplify how specific psychopathological conditions are manifested in language, as well as the corresponding semantic and acoustic qualities over a period of time (?osi? et al., 2021). All individual posts, their contents, and comments on related, continuously monitored, social networks may serve as a source of relevant linguistic features such as word frequencies, lexical diversity, narrative coherence, sentiment of speech content and others, using them to classify major mental health disorders. These features might be calculated, for example by Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), Bag-of-Words model, word2vec and BERT.","War, emotions, mental health, and artificial intelligence"
573,"Can you provide more information on how supervised learning models are utilized in detecting mental illness based on physiological sensors, and the importance of identifying key predictors in developing robust machine learning models for mental health classification?","Machine learning (ML) models have been developed to detect mental illness based on a combination of various multimodal physiological sensors (Chen et al., 2022;�Garriga et al., 2022;�Sabry et al., 2022). The computation of corresponding features, selection and labeling training datasets, and selection of validation and verification datasets using a supervised learning model, can be developed for classification or prediction of different mental health issues. Traditional and most common machine learning methods include: support vector machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), and Logistic Regression (LR;�Sarker, 2021). To develop a robust ML model, it is crucial to identify the primary multimodal features that serve as key predictors of severe mental health conditions (Zhang et al., 2022). The main advantage of supervised learning lies in the model?s ability to learn patterns from labeled datasets, therefore leading to better model performance. However, labeling the large amount of data with high quality is a time consuming and challenging job, therefore the methods that can help reduce the human annotation burden are of special interest. Methods which do not rely on labeled data or need only a small amount of data to train a classifier, are based on unsupervised learning methods which can discover patterns from unlabeled data, such as clustering data.","War, emotions, mental health, and artificial intelligence"
574,What specific NLP methods are mentioned in the text that can enhance word representations and deepen understanding of mental health context and semantics in war-inflicted societies?,"Regarding mental health diagnostic analysis of keywords and statistical representations of words dominates, but involvement of state-of-the-art NLP methods, like large language models (LLM) can significantly improve word representations with better and deeper understanding of mental health context and semantics (Bartal et al., 2024). The interpretation of keyword-based features is much easier, while clarification of context and meaning of words is more abstract. Analyses of dominant emotional maps in war-inflicted societies reveal dominant emotions which people express in online posts or forums, such as fear, sadness and anger. Uncovering the overall emotional tone and how people describe their emotions in the war environment is the right approach to prediction and prevention of potential massive mental health diseases in a reliable and accurate way. Available NLP tools have a variety of computational methods to analyze and understand the emotional content of relevant textual data in war-inflicted societies, enabling better and deeper insights into their emotional states. From the utilization of NLP methodologies and illustrative large-scale data collections, we are able to observe intricate patterns of emotions and sentiments that are manifested in language and associated emotional and semantic characteristics that exhibit dynamic changes over time (Sawalha et al., 2022). Through the examination of posts, we can analyze linguistic features such as word frequencies, lexical diversity, narrative coherence, emotional content, and sentiment content to effectively detect and forecast significant mental health disorders (?osi? et al., 2021). The most commonly used features in mental illness detection are linguistic patterns such as Bag-of-Words, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), sentence and passage length, N-gram language models, emotional thesauri like WordNet-affect, and normative databases like the Affective Norm for English Words. Domain specific ontologies, dictionaries, and social attributes in social networks have the potential to improve accuracy. However, LIWC is the most widely used software tool in mental health research projects which is composed of more than 6,000 words, word stems and selected emotions and calculates approximately 90 output variables (Pennebaker et al., 2015).","War, emotions, mental health, and artificial intelligence"
575,"How do cognitive and drive components play a role in the estimation of dominant emotional states, especially when considering negative emotional maps in a group setting?","The estimation of dominant emotional states may encompass various elements such as aggregated emotional feelings, beliefs, and a behavioral component characterized by impulsive or expressive gestures. Moreover, it incorporates a cognitive element associated with the evaluation of the scenario, as well as a drive component linked to the preparedness for activity (Scherer, 1984). As a result, when estimating dominant negative emotional maps, one must consider not only the collective emotional experience of a group, but also the corresponding behavioral and cognitive components (?osi? et al., 2012a).","War, emotions, mental health, and artificial intelligence"
576,"How can the use of emotional maps based on AI analysis help in understanding and resolving conflicts, particularly in situations of war and trauma, as mentioned in the text?","Analyses of these dominant emotional maps in combination with other relevant efforts are the basis for a comprehensive approach to conflict resolution, and corresponding peaceful policy. Dominant negative emotions, particularly on the global and strategic political scene, are the main driving force of war and global insecurity (Webster and Albertson, 2022). Therefore, estimation and assessment of dominant negative emotion in times of war and trauma are extremely important.�Figure 1�illustrates the hypothetical normalized negative emotional map during the war time. From the illustrated contour plots it is easy to notice that centers of gravity of dominant emotional maps are situated in the upper-left quadrant of the valence/arousal space, due to the presence of negative and mostly arousing emotions, like fear, anger, hatred, frustration etc.","War, emotions, mental health, and artificial intelligence"
577,How can advancements in AI be utilized to effectively identify and assess dominant emotions in war-affected societies for conflict management and societal resilience?,"The estimation and assessment of dominant emotions during and after war is extremely important, but at the same time a very challenging and complex task. In politico-security analyses the aggregation of dominant emotional maps, and their potential transformation into group actionable scenarios, actions, reactions, behavior, and riots, deserves more attention (Lofland, 1985). Participants in the same social situation often share a common awareness and a common emotional reaction to it (Barbalet, 1998;�Pizarro et al., 2022). Aggregation and unification of these individuals? emotional characteristics may lead to strongly unified emotional groups which may become powerful strategic agents in conflict management. Dominant emotional maps determine the ability of a society to cope with its own social and security challenges. Identifying the dominant emotions within populations in war-affected societies should be considered one of the foundational tasks. This endeavor aims to ameliorate negative emotions wherever they exist and capitalize on positive ones.","War, emotions, mental health, and artificial intelligence"
578,How do negative dominant emotional maps impact group willingness and energy to create change in society?,"In order to understand such complex societal situations, analysis of emotional contexts is extremely important and necessary (?osi? et al., 2012b). Each emotion is related to a specific response tendency and action readiness (Frijda, 1987). This means that negative dominant emotional maps have corresponding action tendencies and behaviors, closely related to group willingness and energy to create some kind of change in the society.","War, emotions, mental health, and artificial intelligence"
579,"How do emotions like fear, anger, and despair contribute to the escalation of global security challenges and conflicts?","Global security challenges and wars might be expressed by different negative emotions, particularly those of fear, anger, despair, hatred, resentment, rage, and frustration (Milevski, 2020;�Cricenti et al., 2022). These emotions may escalate into behavior of aggression, war, resistance, terrorism, insurgent action. Emotions may play a very important role in understanding human behavior and have a significant impact on the politico-security analysis. It is almost impossible to fully understand the complexity of global military tension, insecurity and armed conflicts without trying to understand the range and power of emotions in a theater of war. During the war, unlimited production and distribution of negative emotions makes multidimensional emotional space uncontrollable (?osi? et al., 2012b). Therefore, the emotional dimension of any conflict or problem should not be underestimated. War tragedies and the negative emotion of humiliation generates irrational, harmful, devastating and hateful feelings. If emotions are not integrated and embedded into a global multidisciplinary politico-security analysis, the world will be in danger due to ignoring a fundamental aspect of human emotional behavior. Hence, strength and diversity of negative emotions remain a crucial factor in understanding the complexity of the global political and security landscape (?osi? et al., 2018).","War, emotions, mental health, and artificial intelligence"
580,"How do mental health disorders induced by war and trauma impact key human functions like emotions, cognition, and behavior?","The impact of war and trauma on mental health is devastating, particularly for civilians who are living in a state of constant fear, hopelessness, misery, horror, sadness, and humiliation. Individuals in war-inflicted societies are subjected to profoundly traumatic and stressful events that can have detrimental effects on their mental health, leading to anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and suicidal tendencies (Kleber, 2019;�Rozanov et al., 2019;�Jain et al., 2022). Prevalence rates of mental health disorders are strongly correlated with the number of traumatic events people have experienced during war time, as well as their individual stress resilience and vulnerability (Lim et al., 2022). A continuous flow of armed conflicts, global crises, natural disasters, and pandemics has resulted in an unprecedented number of individuals feeling stressed, anxious, depressed, and emotionally fragile (Jakovljevic et al., 2020;�?osi? et al., 2020a;�Kopila? et al., 2021;�Lass-Hennemann et al., 2023;�Mejia et al., 2023;�Prazeres et al., 2023). Globally, yet unrecognized demand for high on-time effective preventive and treatment resources has contributed to a significant mental disease burden. This gap between what is needed and what is available has continued to grow due to the lack of mental health professionals and unmet need for early preventive treatment. Mental health disorders induced by war and trauma may lead to disorganization of key human emotional, cognitive and behavioral functions, like dysregulation of thoughts, emotions, feelings, compromised physiology, immune-inflammatory dysfunction, cognitive distortions and maladaptive coping mechanisms (Rozanov et al., 2019). The impact of war on the overall mental health and well-being might be catastrophic, surpassing the toll inflicted by any major disease in terms of mortality and disability. It can devastate entire nations, communities, families and individuals, frequently disrupting their socio-economic development and prosperity (Betancourt et al., 2018;�Kleber, 2019;�Rozanov et al., 2019;�Trujillo et al., 2021;�Lim et al., 2022).","War, emotions, mental health, and artificial intelligence"
581,How did the researchers address potential bias in the binary label creation process when comparing the text model to the acoustic model for identifying mental health markers?,"In conclusion, in our study we presented, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive overview of Linguistic and Speech markers for Mental Health Disorders. We have found that the text model outperforms by far the acoustic model when identifying mental health markers. However, this may in part be due to bias in the binary label creation process. Furthermore, we observe that the multimodal model comes head to head with the text model and in some cases even outperforms it (i.e. in the F1 scores of all models except Random Forest). Even though this is not the case for every metric, taking into account the performance of the acoustic model, even this modest increase in the F1 scores indicates that the multimodal model is actually affected by the information of both modalities. This is especially so in the case of the F1 scores of the positive cases, which are more important in this study compared to the F1 scores of the negative cases. Therefore, we conclude that a multimodal model for mental health markers identification can indeed outperform unimodal approaches, while providing several research opportunities for further realizing its potential in mental health.",Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health
582,"How does the implementation of text-speech alignment contribute to the improvement of mental health-related AI applications, such as emotion recognition and sentiment analysis?","Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, the implementation of text-speech alignment could also open the path to more sophisticated and complex fusion techniques like hybrid fusion and end-to-end fusion. The first one combines aspects of both early and late fusion. For instance, some features may be combined at an early stage, while others may be merged after some additional individual processing. This way modality-specific processing is preserved (at least at some level) and the model can learn the distinct properties of each modality better. On the other hand, end-to-end fusion involves the integration of modalities at a deep level, with a preference for using deep neural networks, which learn to extract and combine relevant features autonomously. Following this approach, we could for example feed all 300 features into one deep neural network and have it recommend and extract the most optimal combination of features. This is even supported by the fact that this method can dynamically adjust to the modality and feature importance through training. It?s particularly advantageous when there is a more complex and highly non-linear interaction between the modalities.",Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health
583,"How can the ""0.25"" metric be applied in the context of text-speech alignment and why is it relevant in assessing the alignment accuracy?","Other than the implementation of text-speech alignment we would also recommend experimenting with the�??0.25�metric, which is a variance of the�????.�????�is a generalization of the F1 score that allows the alteration of the original weights between precision and recall. For completeness, we provide the equation for�????�below:",Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health
584,Can you explain how text-speech alignment can enhance the integration of modalities and how it could lead to further experimentation with fusion techniques?,"The most significant recommendation we have to offer, regarding the future work, is the implementation of text-speech alignment, which constitutes a significant aspect of multimodality that facilitates a more comprehensive integration of the two modalities. Implementing this process would also open more opportunities for experimenting with other fusion techniques. Although early fusion provided us with a way around text-speech alignment, it may oversimplify the interaction between the two modalities and it is less flexible in handling their distinct characteristics.",Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health
585,"As a student fascinated by AI and mental health implications, I would like to know more about how the balancing and normalization techniques specifically helped in preventing feature dominance and potential bias in the models when combining text and audio modalities.","Risk of feature dominance posed another challenge during the early fusion. Although, giving additional weight to the better performing text features (compared to the acoustic features) proved that it increased the performance of our models, this could potentially lead to an imbalance in feature contribution. It?s possible for the text modality to have dominated the feature importance, overshadowing the audio modality and this would have led to partly biased models. To prevent that we performed modality-specific preprocessing. We followed the exact same scale-balancing (normalization) techniques in every single feature during the development of each unimodal model. By doing that we guaranteed that all features (of both modalities) were on the same scale and their impact should be balanced such that any possible feature dominance would be prevented.",Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health
586,"How did the researchers determine which modalities to focus on in their study, and why did they choose linguistic and audio markers specifically?","In this study we focused on two of the three modalities in the DAIC-WOZ dataset. As such this study is a multimodal extension (linguistic and audio markers) in line with [1] which focused on the identification of linguistic markers only. The second modality (audio) was selected based on compatibility. Transcripts and audio data are usually interconnected in most datasets, just like many of their features. Nevertheless, the inclusion of the video modality as a third provider of mental health illness markers, which is expected to capture important non-verbal indicators such as facial expressions and gestures, has great potential to further enhance the accuracy of mental diseases identification. This will be part of future research.",Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health
587,Can you elaborate on how refining the process of creating binary labels and improving feature engineering for the acoustic model could lead to less biased results in the study and better performance in the multimodal models?,"The limitations of this study can be easily realized through the future work recommendations. Everything mentioned there includes methods and techniques, whose implementations can improve this research significantly. Yet, one important limitation that isn?t mentioned is the process of creating the binary labels. As elaborated above, this process was intuitive and pragmatic but requires further refinement and improvement. Finding a way to make the process more modality neutral, would make the results less skewed towards one modality and less biased. Moreover, along with some refined feature engineering for the acoustic model, its performance could increase and consequently improve the performance of the multimodal models as well.",Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health
588,Can you provide more detail on how emphasizing text features in the multimodal model specifically improved performance and generalization compared to audio features?,"As indicated by the results on Table�15, the best scores are attained by the�20t, 10a�set of features, with a few exceptions appearing with the�20t, 15a�set. However, there is not a single instance of the�15t, 15a�features set pulling off the best results over both of the other two sets. It is evident that assigning additional weight over the textual features brings forwards a boost in the models? performance. By emphasising more on the text features our multimodal model learns to generalize better. This was already indicated earlier, through the big gap between the text model?s and the audio model?s results, but the latest comparison even proved this observation. Regardless, experimenting with a modality balanced features set proved helpful in realizing the flaws and the correct steps in the whole modeling approach.",Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health
589,Can you explain further why the text features are more accurate during predictions compared to the audio features in the unimodal models?,"However, this huge performance gap between the two unimodal models can most probably be attributed to the way that the binary labels were created. Since that process was based on the LIWC categories, which are a text feature, it makes sense for the text features to be more accurate during predictions and for the audio features to encounter some difficulties.",Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health
590,Can you provide more detail on how overfitting is affecting the performance of the RF model compared to the SVM and Logistic Regression models in terms of accuracy and AUC-ROC scores on the test sets?,"Just like with the unimodal approaches, the RF model shows high levels of overfitting here as well. We discovered that the RF model achieves a 100% accuracy and AUC-ROC scores on the train sets, while the results presented on Table�15�are the ones of the test set. This gap is a clear indicator of the presence of overfitting. Unlike RF, SVM only indicates minimal overfitting on the ?20t, 15a? and ?20t, 10a? features sets and mild overfitting on the ?15t, 15a? set. Logistic Regression overfits slightly as well, but not to the point that it is negatively affected.",Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health
591,How do the results indicate the potential impact of feature set size on the performance of Dense Layers in the models?,"The presented results indicate that the ?20t, 10a? features set works great with our models. In all cases, with a couple of exceptions, the particular set pulls off the highest results. The exceptions include the AUC-ROC score achieved by the ?20t, 15a? features set on the SVM model, which is the highest one observed across all cases, and the case of the Dense Layers. Dense Layers appear to work best (overall) with the ?20t, 15a? set, although the score gap with the other two sets isn?t that noteworthy. The ?20t, 15a? features set is the largest one out of the 3, consisting of 35 features, instead of 30. This could possibly mean that Dense Layers can be effectively trained on larger feature sets and even improve their attained results further.",Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health
592,"Can you elaborate on the potential impact of overfitting and feature selection on the SVM model's performance, particularly in relation to predicting marker presence?","By observing the results it?s noticeable that the models performed best with the same feature set sizes, as in text. SVM had the best results with the 20 features set, but it did surprisingly bad in the case of predicting marker presence (F1 score of 1s). With 10 and 15 features, SVM actually had a score of 0 on this metric. This can be attributed to various reasons, like overfitting or feature selection impact. It?s possible that SVM might be overfitting to the majority class (ignoring the minority class entirely), or that the feature selection might not be sufficiently informative for the particular model to distinguish between classes. Logistic Regression, although comparable with SVM at the other metrics, managed to achieve approximately double the score of SVM?s ?F1 score - 1s?. Dense Layers did better than SVM and LogReg, especially with 10 features and it actually achieved the best score on ?F1 - 1s?, along with RF. Both LogReg and Dense Layers performed the best with the 10 features set. Finally, the RF model got the best scores with the 15 features, with the single exception of ?F1 - 1s?, which appeared to be higher with less features (10). It was also interesting how RF performed the best across all models and metrics. We hypothesize that this is due to the fact that the feature sets used were picked by the selector that used RF as its classifier. It is noteworthy to mention that the particular results of RF (on 15 features) were the highest results (for every single evaluation metric) achieved by the unimodal audio model across all feature selectors.",Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health
593,Can you provide more information on why pitch-related features were more prominently selected by the Random Forest model compared to the Logistic Regression model in the feature selection process?,"In the case of the unimodal acoustic model?s feature selection, we noticed that across all different methods and settings, certain features (particularly from the MFCCs and formant features) show a consistency in appearing as significant. This suggests that there may be an important relationship between these features and the target variable across both linear (LogReg) and non-linear (RF) model perspectives. Another notable fact that we noticed is that pitch-related features were more prominently selected by the RF model and specifically with the RFE method. This indicates that the relationship between pitch features and the target variable can probably be captured more effectively compared to linear models (at least in some contexts). Further weight was given in the research of pitch-related features, as they were discussed a lot during related projects. This, in association with the lack of pitch-related features selected by the Logistic Regression model, lead us to conclude that the linear nature of the particular model may not always capture the complex ways in which the specific features contribute to the specific classification task. It?s probably why, Random Forest, being a non-linear model, might be better in capturing such complexities and interactions; for instance if pitch interacts with other features in a way that doesn?t lend itself to linear separation.",Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health
594,"As a student interested in the implications of AI on mental health, I would like to know more about how the concept of overfitting in machine learning models, as mentioned in the text, could potentially impact the development and deployment of AI tools aimed at improving mental health outcomes.","Based on the presented results, it was indicated that each model works best with a different number of features. SVM with a linear kernel and Logistic Regression both perform best with 20 features and it is also clear that they achieve similar scores in all metrics. On the other hand, when tested with 25 features the performance drops and when tested with 30 features the performance dropped even further. This means that the presence of overfitting became more intense and that the addition of more features was redundant. In the case of Random Forest and Dense Layers, the models performed their best across all metrics (with a small exception at the accuracy of the Dense Layers) when given 25 features. Both Random Forest and Dense Layers benefit from having more features. As an ensemble learning method, Random Forest, can use the larger number of features to create more informative splits across its decision trees, which also explains the considerably better score at the AUC-ROC score. Similarly, neural networks can use larger sets of features to learn more complex patterns because of their capacity to handle and learn from additional features. However, when tested with a set of 30 features (using the same feature selector), every model under-performed in every single metric. This implies that after a specific point the models cannot generalize as well.",Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health

Although simple, early fusion is a straightforward and less computationally intensive approach that doesn?t require sophisticated synchronization between the two modalities.",Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health

So, for pitch we had already extracted mean, median and std on the segment level. Following the above aggregation method we got the mean of the�pitch_mean�values across all segments (which is actually the average of the averages), the median of those�pitch_mean�values (central tendency of pitch variation across segments) and also the standard deviation (pitch variability) among those values within an interview. Similarly, we got the mean, median and std of the�pitch_median�and�pitch_std�values of all segments within each interview.",Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health
603,Can you explain how normalizing the features and their statistics contributes to making the analysis and comparison of the data easier in the context of AI advancements in mental health?,"Moving on, using the same formula as for the text model, we normalized all of our features (including the formants set) and their statistics.

Hence, at the early stages of this study we worked with two different sets of features; one at the interview level and one at the segment level. Regardless, in both sets we also extracted the mean, median and standard deviation statistics for every feature.",Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health
605,Can you explain why smaller segmenting of audio files is important for extracting features relevant to mental health markers?,"Once all of our audios were properly noise reduced, we segmented those files into smaller chunks, which would be more easily manageable and could potentially offer more nuanced information during the feature extraction process. Smaller segments allow for more precise calculations of features such as pitch, jitter, shimmer, and MFCCs, which can lead to a better understanding of the audio characteristics relevant to mental health markers. The segmentation was done based on volume and with the addition of some buffering. The reason why this segmentation method was selected is due to the fact that through�Audacity�it was noticed that the participant?s speech was considerably louder compared to that of the interviewer. Additionally, the extra buffering was used so that the segmented chunks would include complete sentences and there wouldn?t be any loss of context.",Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health

607,Can you explain why the unimodal text model selected Logistic Regression as the classifier for the feature set proposed by the best performing selector?,"Every single features set was then evaluated through all of our machine learning models and we moved on with the set proposed by the best performing selector. In the case of the unimodal text model, this set was the one without cross validation, with re-scaling and that employed Logistic Regression as the classifier. Table�10�presents the top 20 features (unordered) selected by the feature selector with these parameters.",Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health
608,Can you explain how the features subset selection process using RFE and RFECV prevents information leakage from the test set and ensures an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance?,"Attempting to acquire a set of features that would eventually bring better results and that could potentially uncover some underlying patterns and relationships between features, we iterated over this process while tuning each of the parameters with respect to the recommended features subset and the modeling results achieved over each iteration. The first parameter was using�RFE�or�RFECV. The first one performs the feature selection given a fixed number of features to select (set by us), while the latter performs the selection using cross validation and finally recommends the best number of features (along with the corresponding top features names) as judged by the assigned scores. The selection process of these methods is performed on the training data, in order to avoid any information from the test set being leaked. This ensures an unbiased evaluation of the model?s performance. In both approaches we experimented both with�Logistic Regression�and with�Random Forest. RFE (as well as RFECV) is a model-specific feature selection method. This means that the final set of features, proposed by the process, is influenced by the characteristics and requirements of the respective model and emphasizes on maximizing its performance. Then, for each predictive model we iterated five times, setting the number of features to 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 (in the case of RFE).",Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health
609,Can you explain why the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) approach was chosen specifically for selecting optimal features from the dataset?,"Since our complete textual features set consists of more than 150 features, which is a huge number considering the dataset?s size, we decided to use a wrapper method and select the most optimal features. We proceeded with the�Recursive Feature Elimination�(RFE) approach, which, as the name implies, works by recursively removing the least important features based on the weights of the model and then re-builds the model until the specified number of features is reached.",Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health
610,Can you explain how the threshold sets were refined and how set 15 was ultimately chosen for labeling?,"Before refining our thresholds, we examined the previously assigned PHQ-8 binary labels. Although, those labels are particularly focused on depression only, we used them as a baseline. The PHQ-8 labels had flagged approximately 30% of the samples as diagnosed with depression and we considered this percentage a good balance between positive and negative cases. As such, we aimed to created a set of thresholds that not only balanced sensitivity and specificity but also achieved a marker presence label assignment close to 30%. On that regard, seeing how Set 8 (from Table�6) achieved the closest marker presence percentage to the PHQ-8 labels, we used it as our new baseline and created 5 more threshold sets. Table�7�presents the characteristics of the refined sets. With a marker presence of 31.7%, we selected set 15 for our labeling. The refined composite set?s alignment with the known prevalence suggests that it effectively captures a realistic proportion of instances with potential markers, indicating its thresholds are well-calibrated. In Table�8, we present the values of the final threshold set.",Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health
611,Can you explain how skewness and kurtosis were used to determine the thresholds for the LIWC categories in the study?,"The first step was to revisit Table�3�and select particular LIWC categories by narrowing down to the most relevant items. The selected categories include�anx, bio, cogproc, death, i, negemo, posemo, relig, sad, social�and�they. The plan was to create a set of thresholds that would help us to classify between the presence or absence of a marker based on whether the value of a threshold is exceeded or not. To discern the optimal values for the LIWC categories? thresholds we extracted the statistical summaries and created the distribution plots for each chosen LIWC category. By observing and comparing those normalized categorical scores, along with studying each category?s�Skewness�and�Kurtosis, we created the first experimental sets of thresholds. For instance, if category ?sad? had a mean value of 1.8 then we created its threshold accordingly. Knowing the skewness (asymmetry of the distribution) and kurtosis (mean outliers) also played a big part in setting thresholds. It helped ensure that the marker identification criteria are not only based on central tendency but also on the distributions? tails. Particularly for categories with high values on these two measures, setting thresholds to capture extreme values ensures that the labeling process is more likely to identify instances that stand out significantly from the norm.",Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health
612,"Can you explain why Z-score normalization was chosen specifically for the feature normalization process, and how does it help in improving the comparability of the data?","With feature extraction complete, the next step was to normalize our features, in order to ensure a consistent scale and consequently improve the comparability of the data. This entails making the data more homogeneous and possibly revealing new patterns in the data that weren?t evident before. For the normalization task, we applied Z-score normalization, also known as standard scaler or standard normal distribution. This method is a specific type of probability distribution that standardizes the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 for each feature.",Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health

614,How exactly does the usage of GloVe embeddings in machine learning models improve performance and aid in dimensionality reduction when it comes to identifying language markers for mental disorders?,"For the GloVe embeddings features, first we downloaded a pre-trained GloVe model, particularly the 100-dimensional (100d) GloVe model, which not only offers a good balance between providing sufficient semantic detail for nuanced text analysis and being computationally efficient (not intensive like the higher-dimensional models), but also provides enough depth in the word embeddings without overfitting. The model we selected is�Wikipedia 2014 + Gigaword 5�that covers a broad range of topics with additional diversity, which is essential in capturing embeddings with terms relevant to mental health contexts. Then the GloVe embeddigns are loaded into python by creating a dictionary, where the keys are words and the values are the corresponding vector representations. GloVe embeddings are especially useful when working with machine learning models, since they can not only improve the model?s performance but also perform dimensionality reduction. Hence, in the context of identifying language markers for mental disorders, GloVe embeddings can be used to perform a more nuanced and morphological analysis of the used words. Their value is also proven by their presence in a big number of related work papers.",Multimodal machine learning for language and speech markers identification in mental health

This opens the door to scaling the model into multiple hospitals while reducing the time dedicated to feature extraction and modeling.

645,Can you explain the difference between false positives and true positives in the context of using AI models for monitoring mental health crises?,"The low precision values should not hinder the clinical use of our models as they are driven by the high number of false positives, in comparison to the number of true positives. Monitoring or contacting a patient that ends up being a false positive (i.e., does not have a crisis in 4 weeks) won?t be harmful for the patient and can, in fact, be beneficial for their mental health condition. The main drawback is the allocation of resources that could have been used toward a higher-risk patient.",Transatlantic transferability and replicability of machine-learning algorithms to predict mental health crises
646,Could you provide more detail on how the inclusion of textual features computed from CUIs improved the predictive power of the model for mental health crises?,"The inclusion of textual features computed from CUIs brought additional predictive power overall (AUROC?=?0.837, AUPRC?=?0.081), and achieved the highest classification metrics at 85% of specificity. This shows that textual features demonstrate potential for predicting mental health crises, and it is plausible that a model incorporating these features if trained on an even larger set of patient data and hospital-specific tuning, could offer clinically relevant improvements. The preprocessing step that converts clinical notes into CUIs simplifies the process of replicating the model from one hospital to another since it standardizes textual data into a set of concepts that are uniquely identified.",Transatlantic transferability and replicability of machine-learning algorithms to predict mental health crises
647,How does the availability of historical EHR data impact the process of implementing AI models in hospital systems for mental health analysis?,"In a setting where historical EHR data is unavailable for a particular hospital system, then a pretrained model can be transferred (UK Original), while if historical EHR data is available but no pretrained model exists (e.g., due to contractual reasons), then one can replicate the feature set and train a new model (UK Retrained). If both historical EHR data and a pretrained model exists then it is possible to combine both (UK Tuned), for increased performance. This method can potentially yield further performance improvements by leveraging data from more than two hospital systems.",Transatlantic transferability and replicability of machine-learning algorithms to predict mental health crises
648,How do the Clinical Utility Indices (CUIs) impact the predictive accuracy of the model in relation to the patient's primary and secondary diagnosis?,"When US-specific features were incorporated, ?Weeks since last crisis? and ?Number of crisis episodes? remained at the top 5 most important features, but a large portion of the most predictive features are specific to the US-based models. Concretely, the other structured features that showed up as highly predictive include the patient?s primary and secondary diagnosis and the number of weeks since the last discharge. Importantly, when the CUIs were included, the model took them into account and they replaced most of the diagnosis features in terms of relevance. A potential reason for this is that the CUIs bring information about the treatment and symptoms that are related to a mental health crisis. For instance, ?Hallucinations, Auditory? and ?Aripiprazole? are related to schizophrenia, and ?Depakote? or ?Lithium? are medications given to patients with bipolar disorder.

The features that had the greatest influence on the predictions across all models were ?Weeks since last crisis? and ?Number of crisis episodes?.

650,What is the significance of the target prevalence in relation to the AUPRC and the precision-recall curves for the UK-based and US-based models?,"As the AUPRC can also be interpreted as the average ranking precision, one can use the target prevalence as a useful benchmark. The overall prevalence of the target variable, which indicates a patient will have a crisis in the next 4 weeks, was 1.10%. The prevalence was 1.24%, 1.05%, and 0.91% in the training, validation and test sets, respectively. As the prevalence of the target in the test set is less than 1% then a random ranking of the patients would yield an AUPRC of less than 0.01, which is 5 to 8 times smaller than the AUPRC of the trained models. If we consider the values of Precision@top100, then we expect to flag 7 to 8 patients (except with UK Original) who will have a crisis in the next 4 weeks, in comparison with a single patient if any 100 patients are selected.

All models were statistically significantly better than the baseline, which determines patients? risk scores based on the number of weeks since the most recent crisis episode, according to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), with all comparisons yielding�p-values <0.001. Moreover, the models that rely on US data for training outperform the UK Original model, trained solely on UK data. The model with the highest AUROC and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) is US CUI tf-idf, showing statistically significant improvements in AUROC against all other models (p-values?<?0.05).

Patients, aged 16 and older with a history of mental health crises, having had at least one crisis episode, were included in this study. This yielded a study cohort containing records from 2907 unique patients aged between 16 and 100 years, with both genders being well represented (54.5% males, 45.5% females).

In contrast, the EHR dataset from the US healthcare provider solely comprised inpatient data. These differences significantly impact the level of data granularity available within each setting, posing a considerable challenge to the replicability of features and prediction models.

656,How do the challenges related to transferability and replication of machine learning models impact the development and application of predictive models in the mental health domain?,"Despite the pivotal role of understanding whether a model can be transferred or replicated and how well it would perform, only a handful of studies touched upon the replication of machine learning models16�or their transfer17?24�across different hospitals. Even a smaller fraction of the studies attempted to replicate their findings internationally25?28. Particularly, the successful transferability of algorithms appears to be highly domain-specific. However, within the mental health domain, especially in the context of predicting significant events and crises, these vital aspects of transferability and applicability, in large part, remain uncharted. Moreover, clinical prediction models have been increasingly criticized for their illusory generalizability and for underperforming when applied out-of-sample29.",Transatlantic transferability and replicability of machine-learning algorithms to predict mental health crises
657,What are some specific examples of how machine learning techniques are being used in psychiatry to predict mental health crises and improve proactive healthcare?,"The evolution of machine learning (ML) techniques, along with research on their applicability across different medical domains, has paved the way for predictive analytics of critical events in areas such as cardiovascular disorders, circulatory failure, and diabetes8?12. In psychiatry, predictive models leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) are emerging as a promising avenue for forecasting mental health crises13,14, thus enabling a long-awaited shift from reactive to proactive healthcare. Moreover, these predictive tools hold the potential to alleviate the global burden of mental disorders, which ranked as the second leading cause of years lived with disability in 201915. However, a notable gap in the current predictive analytics landscape is the robustness of the algorithms across diverse healthcare systems, which limits their adoption and practical use. The predominant focus of research has been placed on developing and evaluating models within single test-bed settings, thereby leaving us ill-informed about the universal applicability and scalability of ML in psychiatry.",Transatlantic transferability and replicability of machine-learning algorithms to predict mental health crises
658,"How were the machine learning models trained and validated in the study, and what were the key factors that influenced their performance in predicting mental health crises?","Transferring and replicating predictive algorithms across healthcare systems constitutes a unique yet crucial challenge that needs to be addressed to enable the widespread adoption of machine learning in healthcare. In this study, we explored the impact of important differences across healthcare systems and the associated Electronic Health Records (EHRs) on machine-learning algorithms to predict mental health crises, up to 28 days in advance. We evaluated both the transferability and replicability of such machine learning models, and for this purpose, we trained six models using features and methods developed on EHR data from the Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust in the UK. These machine learning models were then used to predict the mental health crises of 2907 patients seen at the Rush University System for Health in the US between 2018 and 2020. The best one was trained on a combination of US-specific structured features and frequency features from anonymized patient notes and achieved an AUROC of 0.837. A model with comparable performance, originally trained using UK structured data, was transferred and then tuned using US data, achieving an AUROC of 0.826.

Consequently, some of our findings may have been overtaken by the progress in research.",The Use of Deep Learning and Machine Learning on Longitudinal Electronic Health Records for the Early Detection and Prevention of Diseases: Scoping Review
661,"What are the key considerations for integrating ML and DL models into clinical practice, particularly in the context of using EHRs for patient risk classification?","Our final research question sought the (possible) clinical benefits that could be obtained from using ML on EHRs. We found that preliminary screening was a clinical benefit of applying such models on longitudinal EHRs. Patients were accurately classified into risk classes to prioritize those with the highest risk, and a positive net benefit was found. In addition, the authors of the studies stated that their results (although they were not clinically evaluated) may contribute to a more personalized health care, prevention possibilities, and health care policies and reduce the clinicians? workload. These benefits are perfectly aligned with the near-future vision, strategies, and action foci set by the World Health Organization [62,63]. In particular, the emerging clinical staff shortage makes the future health care system more dependent on technical innovations and the health care system will be forced to be digitally assisted [64]. However, to be adopted in medical practice, ML and DL models require external validation, the absence of bias and drift, and transparency for clinicians. In prior work, benefits have rarely been clinically evaluated either. Even in a more mature health domain regarding ML, the intensive care unit, only 2% of the AI applications are clinically evaluated [65]. In their systematic review, the clinical readiness of AI was explored, but no AI model was found to be integrated into routine clinical practice at the time of writing. The limited amount of publications evaluating the clinical benefits of the application of ML on EHRs indicates the research gap in the literature. Future studies should explore the follow-up of these AI attempts and the reasons for success or failure in practice.",The Use of Deep Learning and Machine Learning on Longitudinal Electronic Health Records for the Early Detection and Prevention of Diseases: Scoping Review
662,Can you explain more about the potential benefits and challenges of utilizing longitudinal EHR data in combination with neural network architectures like RNN and LSTM for the early detection and prevention of diseases?,"The second research question determined the scope of what EHR data have been used by ML techniques for the early detection and prevention of diseases. This scoping review found that age, sex, BMI, symptoms, procedures, laboratory test results, diagnoses, medications, and clinical notes are frequently used. Diseases that could be detected earlier than when they are currently diagnosed did not use other EHR variables. In addition, the most important predictors found in multiple studies were age, blood pressure, BMI, cholesterol, smoking, and medication. The consistency in the used and most important EHR variables underlines the importance of establishing generalized regulation and standardization of these variables across electronic health software, especially for variables overlapping in various health disciplines [53]. This would also address well-known challenges and limitations with EHR data, which will be discussed later in this section. According to the literature on the use of EHR data, it seems that a larger variable set improves disease prediction [51]. Their systematic review concluded that studies must leverage the full breadth of EHR data by using longitudinal data. In addition, we found that large longitudinal EHR data can successfully be analyzed via RNN and, derived from it, LSTM. These are both neural network architectures that are able to find patterns while incorporating temporality, making them effective for time-series predictions. Other types of neural networks (eg, convolutional neural networks) are well-known for their performance on images [15]. Similar results for techniques were identified in a review on the same topic from a technical perspective [2]. They concluded that RNN (specifically LSTM) was the most prominent technique to capture complex time-varying EHRs. Another review on AI techniques to facilitate earlier diagnoses of cancer also stated that neural networks were the dominant technique applied to EHRs [54]. Our results showed that there was no consistent way to process EHR variables temporally when techniques other than LSTM and RNN were used. Therefore, we can conclude that a basic RNN and LSTM are the most suitable techniques to analyze multivariable, longitudinal EHRs.",The Use of Deep Learning and Machine Learning on Longitudinal Electronic Health Records for the Early Detection and Prevention of Diseases: Scoping Review
663,How do the authors suggest that the implementation of machine learning and deep learning models could improve personalized healthcare and preventative measures in the context of mental health?,"Only 10% (2/20) of the included studies were validated using an external data set, but none of the models have been implemented in clinical practice (yet). Consequently, the benefits for health were not evaluated. However, the authors interpreted their findings and suggested opportunities and possible health care benefits for clinical practice. The authors of 35% (7/20) of the studies mentioned that, if their models were applied in clinical practice, this may improve personalized health care [34-36,42,45-47]. Personalized health care was related to a personalized risk prediction, an individual-level index or output, a tailored care plan, and targeted care and screening. The authors of 60% (12/20) of the studies claimed that prevention could be improved by using their ML and DL models [31-38,42,44,45,47]. Early and timely detection and interventions before disease manifestation were often mentioned. In one case, the use of DL on EHRs could not directly prevent the targeted outcome, but by better preparing health care in an appropriate setting, indirect health outcomes could be prevented [44]. Additional suggestions to improve health care were focused on policies. It was suggested to base health policies on risk classes at a nationwide level [39,42]. Moreover, (predicted) future health conditions may be a better base for health care policies than traditional surveillance models reflecting health conditions from years before [47]. In addition to this, DL support can reduce the clinical workload. Even if the positive predictive value to select a screening population is low, a model with an excellent sensitivity can reduce the clinician?s workload by 70% [44]. All studies assumed EHR data to be valuable information to improve health care. The author of one study suggested that even imperfect data can be used as a silver standard to develop risk models [36].",The Use of Deep Learning and Machine Learning on Longitudinal Electronic Health Records for the Early Detection and Prevention of Diseases: Scoping Review
664,How did the study by Hung et al [47] use deep learning predictions to create a health index and what were the key health indicators that the index focused on?,"In total, 10% (2/20) of the studies used EHRs not to predict the risk of a disease but to create other health indicators. Hung et al [47] developed a health index based on 3 DL predictions of impactful and costly health indicators (mortality, hospitalization, and cancer). This health index also generated insights into the population?s health and was found to be close to the ?true risk? and, therefore, a better indicator than baseline models. Another study claimed to forecast what disease an individual would have at the next hospital visit [48]. Their results showed that the developed model generated well-performing results in forecasting medical diagnoses aggregated in 3- and 4-digit International Classification of Diseases, 9th and 10th�Revision codes.",The Use of Deep Learning and Machine Learning on Longitudinal Electronic Health Records for the Early Detection and Prevention of Diseases: Scoping Review
665,Can you provide examples of specific studies mentioned in the text that focused on predicting disease occurrences earlier than the moment they were diagnosed by clinicians in EHRs?,"In 45% (9/20) of the studies, ML and DL models observed all available EHR data to classify patients as a case or control (ie, ML vs human detection) [30,33,34,36,38,39,42,43,45]. However, in the other studies (10/20, 50%), models were able to detect diseases earlier than the moment they were diagnosed by clinicians in EHRs (ie, prediction) [29,31,32,35,37,40,41,44,46-48]. By dividing the participants? EHRs into 2 pieces, X years were observed (observation period), and based on these data, it was possible to predict the risk of developing a disease or medical event in the future (prediction period). In other words, the prediction was made at an earlier time (x=0) than when it was diagnosed in practice (end of black bars). In some studies (5/20, 25%), it was part of the research to identify what time frame encompasses enough predictive information and, therefore, how much earlier an (accurate) detection was possible [32,33,37,43,46]. For example, Walsh et al [46] used 2 years of EHRs and extended their prediction window more and more to find the earliest moment of an accurate prediction. Raket et al [35] predicted whether a psychosis would occur 1 year before its onset, whereas Zhao et al [40] used 7 years of EHRs to predict the occurrence of cardiovascular events in the following 10 years.�Figure 2�[29-48] illustrates the different time frames of longitudinal EHRs and their results according to a possible earlier detection.

Optimal prevention in health care settings can be reached when participants at risk or signs of a disease are detected as early as possible, and therefore, these studies were eligible in the context of secondary prevention. Secondary prevention emphasizes early disease detection in subclinical forms and seeks to prevent the onset of illness [23].

678,How can machine learning and deep learning models assist clinicians in analyzing electronic health records to predict disease progression or therapy success?,"It is currently known that supportive tools can simplify complex diagnostic tasks and reduce potential diagnostic errors [13]. There is accumulating evidence suggesting that machine learning (ML) can assist clinicians in analyzing large-scale EHRs as they thrive on high volumes of data. ML is able to fit models specifically adapted to patterns in the data and, compared to traditional statistics, is able to handle multidimensional data [14]. Deep learning (DL) is a subdomain of ML that uses neural networks with multiple (hidden) layers, incorporating complex interactions between variables [15]. Examples of well-developed ML models are based on imaging data for disease detection [16,17] and textual EHRs of hospitalization or intensive care data for predicting disease progression or therapy success [18]. One of the most promising aspects of DL in the context of EHRs containing historical and present clinical data is the ability to incorporate temporality into the model, that is, to base possible risk assessments on hidden patterns over time in clinical parameters. Indeed, DL models have also proved to be more effective by incorporating temporal information (ie, longitudinally processed) rather than cross-sectional information only [19]. Although the techniques of many ML (including DL) models have proved to be effective on EHRs, their focus is often on the engineering of architectures and frameworks [20], but they lack medical outcomes.",The Use of Deep Learning and Machine Learning on Longitudinal Electronic Health Records for the Early Detection and Prevention of Diseases: Scoping Review
679,How can electronic health records (EHRs) contribute to early detection of diseases and risk assessment in patients?,"Digitizing meaningful health information has been proven to contribute to diagnostics. Electronic health records (EHRs) are a digital repository of patient data and contain retrospective, current, and prospective information supporting health care [1]. EHRs contain a wealth of clinical information about early symptoms of a disease and registries of medical treatments [2]. These can be textual or imaging data and include both unstructured clinical notes and structured, coded data. One important aspect of textual EHRs is that they may include risk and preventive factors and early signs before a disease manifests. Especially for patients with multiple visits, many possible indicators are gathered in EHRs, resulting in possible early indications of disease. Therefore, for a good risk assessment, clinicians need the patient?s health information, physical examinations, laboratory test results, and history [3] available in EHRs.",The Use of Deep Learning and Machine Learning on Longitudinal Electronic Health Records for the Early Detection and Prevention of Diseases: Scoping Review
680,"Could you provide more information on the specific mental, behavioral, and neurodevelopmental disorders that were detected or predicted using electronic health record data and machine learning techniques in the studies included?","In total, 20 studies were included, mainly published between 2018 and 2022. They showed that a variety of diseases could be detected or predicted, particularly diabetes; kidney diseases; diseases of the circulatory system; and mental, behavioral, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Demographics, symptoms, procedures, laboratory test results, diagnoses, medications, and BMI were frequently used EHR data in basic recurrent neural network or long short-term memory techniques. By developing and comparing ML and DL models, medical insights such as a high diagnostic performance, an earlier detection, the most important predictors, and additional health indicators were obtained. A clinical benefit that has been evaluated positively was preliminary screening. If these models are applied in practice, patients might also benefit from personalized health care and prevention, with practical benefits such as workload reduction and policy insights.",The Use of Deep Learning and Machine Learning on Longitudinal Electronic Health Records for the Early Detection and Prevention of Diseases: Scoping Review

682,"How were the genes KCNE1, MAPK3, and STIP1 identified as being causally associated with MDD in this study, and what specific roles do they play in the pathogenesis of the disorder?","This integrative multi-omics and multi-trait study identified numerous genes linking OS to MDD pathogenesis, including three genes,�KCNE1, MAPK3, and�STIP1, causally associated with MDD. These gene in particular could serve as diagnostic markers and drug targets for MDD treatment. In addition, the dozens of other genes identify may provide clues to novel pathological mechanisms for MDD.",Novel therapeutic targets for major depressive disorder related to oxidative stress identified by integrative multi-omics and multi-trait study
683,"Can you provide more information on how activation of STIP1 expression could be a useful therapeutic strategy against MDD, and what role does STIP1 play in enhancing neuritogenesis and neuronal survival?","These same genomics analyses also revealed downregulation of�STIP1, which encodes a co-chaperone that interacts with heat-shock proteins 70 and 90, in the blood tissue of MDD patients, in accord with previous reports [64,�65]. Further, SMR identified�STIP1�as a protective target against MDD (OR?=?0.792, 95% CI?=?0.641?0.979). Thus, activation of�STIP1�expression may be a useful therapeutic strategy against MDD. In addition to acting as a chaperone, extracellular�STIP1�acts as a trophic factor to engage PrPC, thereby enhancing neuritogenesis and neuronal survival [66,�67]. Studies have also implicated�STIP1�in functional recovery after stroke and regulation of A? peptide toxicity in Alzheimer?s disease models. Moreover, a GWAS analysis identified a�STIP1�polymorphism as a potential risk factor for attention-deficit disorder [68]. Mice with elevated�STIP1�levels (up to nearly fivefold) showed no neuropathology, anxiety-like behaviors, depression-like behaviors, spatial memory deficits, or attention deficits [69], suggesting that�STIP1�augmentation may be a feasible strategy for antidepressant treatment; however, the detailed underlying mechanisms remain unclarified.",Novel therapeutic targets for major depressive disorder related to oxidative stress identified by integrative multi-omics and multi-trait study
684,Can you provide more information on how the upregulation of KCNE1 and MAPK3 may increase the risk of major depressive disorder (MDD) and why they are potential drug targets?,"We also conducted SMR analysis to identify new causal genes for MDD as such genes may be prime drug targets. Upregulation of�KCNE1�and�MAPK3�were found to increase MDD risk, potentially by promoting pathogenic mechanisms involving OS. The�MAPK3�product extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and cell cycle progression among other vital processes [45]. It has been reported that ERK signaling is significantly downregulated in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of both human patients and animal models of chronic depression [46?48]. The ERK1/2 isoforms are the most thoroughly investigated and well characterized isoforms in the central nervous system [44,�49,�50], and both have been found to promote OS via ROS production and to amplify the inflammatory response through activation of the stress-responsive transcription factor NF?B [51,�52]. At present, most studies on the role of�MAPK3�in MDD have focused on the brain, while few studies have investigated expression changes in more accessible blood samples. Moreover, most studies have focused on ERK1/2, but few specifically on ERK1. We found higher�MAPK3�expression in the blood tissue of MDD patients compared to controls, consistent with previous findings. One prospective case-control study reported that a�MAPK3�SNP enhanced interferon-�-induced depression, possibly by increasing the propensity for glutamate dysregulation [53]. A bioinformatics analysis identified 5 genes including�MAPK3�as key modulators of post-stroke depression risk, disease biomarkers, and therapeutic targets of acupuncture [54]. Others have found significant associations of�MAPK3�with schizophrenia, and a recent genome-wide Mendelian randomization analysis identified�MAPK3�as a potential drug target for schizophrenia treatment [55], in line with previous studiess [56,�57]. Based on these and our own findings, we speculate that�MAPK3�may be a critical mediator of OS effects on MDD pathogenesis and thus a promising therapeutic target. However, in our present study,�MAPK3�appeared to make only a limited contribution (OR?=?1.023, 95% CI?=?1.004?1.043). Nonetheless, the contributions of�MAPK3�to OS and MDD warrant further exploration.",Novel therapeutic targets for major depressive disorder related to oxidative stress identified by integrative multi-omics and multi-trait study
685,How did the study demonstrate the involvement of oxidative stress-related genes in the pathogenesis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) using machine learning algorithms and other analytical techniques?,"To our best knowledge, this is the first study on the contributions of oxidative stress-related genes to MDD pathogenesis using integrated multi-omics, machine learning, infiltrated immune cell profiling, genome-wide association, and summary data-based Mendelian randomization analysis. We identified 38 genes differentially expressed between MDD patients and controls that were also associated with OS, of which 32 were deemed important to the influence of OS on MDD pathogenesis (MDD?OS interaction genes) in training and validation cohorts by 6 separate machine learning algorithms. Further screening of blood tissue expression profiles by SMR analysis identified�KCNE1, MAPK3, and�STIP1�as key linkage genes between OS and MDD. These DEGs may thus be convenient biomarkers for MDD as well as potential treatment targets.",Novel therapeutic targets for major depressive disorder related to oxidative stress identified by integrative multi-omics and multi-trait study
686,"Can you explain the specific methods used for the SMR analysis in evaluating the association strengths of the key genes with MDD, and how exactly were the odds ratios (OR) calculated for genes such as KCNE1, MAPK3, and STIP1 in relation to MDD?","We also performed SMR analysis to evaluate the association strengths of these 32 key genes with MDD (with�P�values?<?0.05 set as the threshold for statistical significance). Results revealed an association between elevated expression of�KCNE1�and MDD odds (OR?=?1.057, 95% CI?=?1.013?1.102,�P�value?=?0.010) (Fig.�10A, B, G). Similarly, elevated�MAPK3�expression was associated with greater MDD odds (OR?=?1.023, 95% CI?=?1.004?1.043,�P�value?=?0.020) (Fig.�10C, D, G), while upregulation of�STIP1�was associated with reduced MDD odds (OR?=?0.792, 95% CI?=?0.641?0.979,�P�value?=?0.031) (Fig.�10E, F, G).

697,"One question might be: Can you provide more detail on how Mendelian randomization studies are being used to investigate the causal relationship between oxidative stress-related biomarkers and major depressive disorder (MDD), as mentioned in the text?","Current research utilizing Mendelian randomization (MR) studies, a research approach that uses genetic variants associated with target biological intermediates to assess disease causality, has begun to explore the causal relationship between oxidative stress-related biomarkers and MDD, among other psychiatric disorders. One notable study conducted a bidirectional MR analysis to investigate the causal links between oxidative stress injury biomarkers and several psychiatric disorders, including MDD. The study found that while most oxidative stress-related biomarkers did not show a significant causal relationship with psychiatric disorders, there were some interesting associations. Specifically, the study observed that lower levels of bilirubin were significantly associated with an increased risk of MDD, suggesting a potential protective role of bilirubin against depression. Furthermore, MDD was also found to have suggestive causal effects on certain oxidative stress biomarkers, including increased levels of uric acid and decreased ascorbate [21]. The recent two-sample MR analyses exploring causal relationships between antioxidant targets and psychiatric disorders showed that lower levels of Prolyl 4-Hydroxylase, Transmembrane gene expression in the cerebellum could decrease the incidence of MDD [22].

709,How can advancements in AI potentially be used to support marginalized individuals in leveraging camouflaging/IM strategies for better mental health outcomes?,"Future research disambiguating aversive IM strategies from comparatively beneficial ones is necessary. This distinction, with proper consideration of social contextual factors, could support marginalized individuals in leveraging camouflaging/IM to maximize wellbeing while minimizing mental health costs. It also offers clinical implications. For example, social skills interventions for autistic young people might inadvertently instill camouflaging strategies that come with undesired mental health burdens. Therefore, clinicians could consider approaches that are environment-focused, shifting from modifying behavioral presentations to alleviating the internalized stigma and the social anxiety experienced by autistic people. It is necessary to address stigma as a root social determinant of mental health across social and neurodiverse groups, through means such as modifying the social space (e.g. promoting public education, positive social contact, and inter-community connectedness), ultimately enhancing self-acceptance and wellbeing of neurodivergent and other marginalized people (Alegr�a et al., 2023).","Camouflaging, internalized stigma, and mental health in the general population"
710,One question I have is: How can longitudinal designs provide a more definitive understanding of the causal relationships between camouflaging/IM and mental health?,"Several limitations warrant consideration. First, the cross-sectional data do not permit the validation of definitive causal relations among tested variables. While findings align with predictions from the transactional IM framework (Ai et al., 2022), we are cautious not to overstate the mechanistic relationships. Critically, our data cannot fully elucidate the feedback loop between camouflaging/IM and social anxiety. This kind of reciprocal relation could also apply to other drivers and outcomes of camouflaging/IM that await future research. Longitudinal designs provide a more definitive understanding of the causal relations and their trajectories. These designs could integrate qualitative approaches across developmental stages, particularly during childhood and adolescence, to offer insights into how camouflaging/IM and mental health co-evolve in increasingly complex social environments.","Camouflaging, internalized stigma, and mental health in the general population"
711,How do the findings in the text suggest that social anxiety and internalized stigma may play reciprocal roles in driving individuals to engage in camouflaging/IM?,"The mediation analyses reaffirm that internalized stigma related to each person?s self-reported minoritized identity likely drives IM. Although previous studies regarded social anxiety as an outcome of camouflaging/IM (Hull et al., 2021;�Lorenz & Hull, 2024;�Oshima et al., 2024), we showed that social anxiety could also be an explanatory mechanism. In essence, the social anxiety stemming from internalized stigma motivates individuals to engage in camouflaging/IM, and this, in turn, might further increase social anxiety?a reciprocal pathway that needs further empirical validation (Ai et al., 2022). Another new discovery is that this indirect pathway is moderated by autistic traits. The social anxiety in response to internalized stigma seemed to be a more salient IM driver for individuals with lower rather than higher autistic traits. Whereas camouflaging/IM is largely concerned with facilitating positive social perceptions in dominant social groups, it may instead be more of a survival mechanism for marginalized groups, including those diagnosed with autism or who have evident autistic traits, to manage threats of pathologization, harm, and trauma (Ai et al., 2022;�Bernardin, Mason, et al., 2021;�Pearson & Rose, 2021). Increased social difficulties and stigma associated with higher autistic traits might have sufficiently compelled IM to a great degree. Another possibility is that high autistic traits are associated with different social needs and processing that elicit unique attunement of social uncertainties (e.g. expectations, protocols). Social anxiety in autistic people is linked with poorer social skills and reduced social motivation (Spain et al., 2018), which might hinder camouflaging/IM frequency and success. Research is needed to understand the variations in which autistic cognitive features and social anxiety interact with camouflaging/IM in context-dependent ways.","Camouflaging, internalized stigma, and mental health in the general population"
712,"How do societal expectations of gender stereotypes impact the mental health of individuals, particularly in terms of camouflaging behaviors?","Importantly, the camouflaging-mental health links in the general population are dependent on additional factors. Women, on average, reported poorer mental health from camouflaging/IM than men. In many modern societies, women face strong social pressure to conform to gender stereotypes of communality, emotional sensitivity, and submissiveness (Guadagno & Cialdini, 2007;�Lee et al., 1999). These stereotypically feminine traits are expected of women yet less valued in social situations (e.g. the workplace) pertaining to career progress and self-achievement, whereas stereotypically masculine traits of assertiveness and competitiveness are seen as more desirable (Heilman, 2012;�Hentschel et al., 2019). This incongruence between expected and valued traits entails that women?s camouflaging/IM are less agentic, more vigilant, and more taxing compared with that of men, and thus might more rapidly deplete self-regulatory resources, increase anxiety, and erode mental wellbeing.","Camouflaging, internalized stigma, and mental health in the general population"
713,How do levels of autistic traits impact the relationship between internalized stigma and social anxiety in individuals?,"We then assessed the theoretical mechanistic relationships among internalized stigma, social anxiety, IM, and mental health (Figure 3). Social anxiety partially mediated the link between internalized stigma and IM, an effect uniquely moderated by autistic traits. Compared to individuals with lower autistic traits, those with higher autistic traits were less driven by social anxiety to cope with internalized stigma through IM. Importantly, IM partially mediated the links between internalized stigma and all mental health outcomes, except mental wellbeing, across genders and levels of autistic and ADHD traits.","Camouflaging, internalized stigma, and mental health in the general population"
714,Can you please clarify how the mediation path from internalized stigma to internalized misogyny through social anxiety was moderated by levels of autistic traits in the study?,"For moderated mediation, we found a significant index of moderated mediation (?0.025, 95% bootCI [?0.444, ?0.008]), such that the mediation path from internalized stigma to IM through social anxiety was moderated by autistic trait levels (Figure 3b). Specifically, the mediation effect of social anxiety was significant across all autistic trait levels, but the effect was strongest for lower (-1SD) autistic traits and weakest for higher (+1SD) autistic traits. The mediation path from internalized stigma to IM through social anxiety was consistent across genders and levels of ADHD traits. Lastly, the mediation effects of IM on the associations between internalized stigma and mental health were consistent across genders and levels of autistic and ADHD traits.","Camouflaging, internalized stigma, and mental health in the general population"
715,"How do self-presentation tactics relate to mental wellbeing, subjective authenticity, and specific traits such as autistic and ADHD traits according to the findings in the study?","For self-presentation (Figure 2b,�Supplemental Table SM.2), the step 3 model with the interaction terms was also found to be optimal (Supplemental Table SM.3). Increased self-presentation tactics use significantly predicted better mental wellbeing and reduced subjective authenticity. Women who engaged in increased self-presentation reported lower mental wellbeing and greater self-regulatory fatigue than men who engaged in increased self-presentation. Increased self-presentation predicted greater generalized anxiety with increased levels of autistic traits. With increased levels of ADHD traits, increased self-presentation predicted better mental wellbeing and lower self-regulatory fatigue.","Camouflaging, internalized stigma, and mental health in the general population"
716,Can you explain how the Hayes PROCESS Model-7 was utilized and what specific factors were considered in assessing the moderation effects in the study?,"We then used Hayes? PROCESS Model-7 (Hayes, 2013) to assess whether the estimated simple mediation effects are moderated by gender, autistic, and ADHD traits. Gender was dummy-coded, and men was used as the reference group while women and gender-diverse were interchanged as either the moderator or covariate to assess gender-moderation effects. An index of moderated mediation was calculated for each level of the moderators and bootstrapped for 5000 iterations to obtain bootstrapped confidence intervals (bootCI) of coefficients.","Camouflaging, internalized stigma, and mental health in the general population"
717,"Can you explain in more detail how the interaction terms involving camouflaging, gender, autistic traits, and ADHD traits were specifically incorporated into the regression analysis, and how they contributed to understanding their influence on mental health outcomes?","We performed a three-step hierarchical multivariate regression. At step 1, demographic variables (i.e. age, ethnicity, gender) and neurodivergent traits (i.e. autistic and ADHD traits) were entered as covariates in the nested model predicting anxiety, depression, mental wellbeing, self-regulatory fatigue, and subjective authenticity. At step 2, CAT-Q was additionally entered to assess whether camouflaging tendencies predicted mental health outcomes over and beyond gender and neurodivergent trait differences. At step 3, interaction terms were added to assess whether camouflaging interacted with gender, autistic traits, and ADHD traits, respectively, to influence mental health outcomes. These models were compared via an analysis of variance model comparisons test (Supplemental Table SM.3). After the most optimal model was determined, multiple comparisons were corrected for using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (False Discovery Rate, FDR 0.05) to the�p-values of all predictors included (Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995). Finally, to illustrate whether the mental health outcomes related to camouflaging are comparable to those of self-presentation, the same hierarchical multivariate regression procedures were repeated by replacing CAT-Q with SPT in the modeling process.","Camouflaging, internalized stigma, and mental health in the general population"
718,What specific statistical tests were used in each of the sequential analyses to address the two study aims?,"All analyses were performed with R version 4.2.1(R Core Team, 2018).

719,How did the researchers adapt the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness Inventory 10-Item Version (ISMI-10) for the general population in this study?,"The CAT-Q (Hull et al., 2019) measured camouflaging. The Self-Presentation Tactics (SPT) scale (Lee et al., 1999) measured specific self-presentation strategies as a generic IM construct. The Subthreshold Autism Trait Questionnaire (SATQ;�Kanne et al., 2012) measured dimensional autistic traits, and the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale Part A (ASRS-A;�Kessler et al., 2007) measured dimensional ADHD traits. Social anxiety symptoms were measured using the social fear subscale of the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS;�Liebowitz, 1987). Internalized stigma was measured using the Shortened Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness Inventory 10-Item Version (ISMI-10;�Boyd et al., 2014); here, the ISMI-10 was adapted for the general population, whereby participants reported the most salient minority group that they belong to (e.g. concerning gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, atypical hobbies or interests, physical or mental disabilities), and based their reports of internalized stigma-related experiences on this minority identity.","Camouflaging, internalized stigma, and mental health in the general population"
720,Can you provide more information on the demographic characteristics of the participants in the study and how they were recruited?,"Participants were compensated at USD $9.50?per hour and were recruited using a U.S. general population representative sampling method, which leveraged U.S. census data (U.S. Census Bureau, 2015) for demographic stratification across age, ethnicity, and sex. Five participants were excluded due to age misreporting (exceeding 400?years) or failed attention checks, and 74 participants with incomplete item-level data were also excluded. The final dataset comprised complete item-level data from 972 participants (Table 1). The psychometric properties of the Camouflaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire (CAT-Q;�Hull et al., 2019) in the general population have been examined using the current sample (Ai et al., 2024).

721,"How does the transactional IM framework contribute to understanding the relationships between camouflaging, self-presentation, internalized stigma, social anxiety, and mental health outcomes in the general population?","Here, we assessed the theoretical mental health ramifications of camouflaging in the general population, and how these relations were mediated and moderated by key mechanistic factors (Figure 1), as informed by the transactional IM framework (Ai et al., 2022). First, we investigated whether the mental health outcomes of camouflaging and self-presentation overlap in the general population and assessed the moderating roles of gender, autistic, and ADHD traits. Second, to assess theoretical mechanistic relationships, we evaluated whether social anxiety mediates the link between internalized stigma and camouflaging/IM, and whether camouflaging/IM mediates the links between internalized stigma and mental health outcomes. The findings would confer novel, clarifying insights into how camouflaging arises from social pressures and shapes mental well-being across human groups.","Camouflaging, internalized stigma, and mental health in the general population"
722,"How do perceived and internalized stigma differ in their impact on camouflaging/IM and mental health outcomes, and how can this impact vary across different neurodiverse and social groups?","Altogether, both social stigma and its mitigation through camouflaging/IM can be psychologically adverse (Field et al., 2024;�Han et al., 2021;�Zhuang et al., 2023). Yet, there are insufficient empirical findings chaining these relationships. One avenue is to examine the indirect effect of stigma on mental health through camouflaging/IM. This indirect pathway was previously investigated in autistic adults and camouflaging did not mediate the relationship between autism-related stigma and mental health (Perry et al., 2022). However, this study used a broad measure of mental well-being (Tennant et al., 2007) without assessing specific mental health domains. Further, this study measured perceived but not internalized stigma, which could compel more pervasive camouflaging/IM and severe mental health repercussions (Botha et al., 2022;�Han et al., 2021;�Huang et al., 2023). Empirical investigations are needed to determine if this mediating role of camouflaging/IM exists and if it shows continuity across neurodiverse and social groups.","Camouflaging, internalized stigma, and mental health in the general population"
723,Can you provide examples of the specific ways in which individuals with ADHD may exhibit unique features in their camouflaging behaviors compared to those with autism?,"Camouflaging/IM could be more pervasive and taxing for autistic than non-autistic people given their neurodevelopmental differences in a world saturated by neurotypical social expectations (Ai et al., 2022;�Bolis et al., 2017;�Milton, 2012). Non-autistic people with elevated autistic traits might also camouflage to mitigate comparable social difficulties as autistic people and face similar mental health impacts (Miller et al., 2021;�O?Loghlen & Lang, 2023;�Somerville et al., 2023). Emerging findings show that camouflaging in people with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) shares similar motivation, strategies, and outcomes with autistic camouflaging, but unique features may emerge from interactions with ADHD traits (Ginapp et al., 2023;�Lai et al., 2022;�Merkt et al., 2015).","Camouflaging, internalized stigma, and mental health in the general population"
724,Can you provide examples of specific mental health outcomes that may be associated with camouflaging within the proposed transactional IM framework?,"We have proposed the transactional IM framework (Ai et al., 2022) to guide theory-driven research on camouflaging across autistic and general populations (Fombonne, 2020;�Lai et al., 2021;�Williams, 2021). This framework conceptualizes camouflaging as a component of IM experiences (e.g. self-presentation, self-concealment, self-monitoring) that pervade human social lives (Goffman, 1959;�Leary & Kowalski, 1990). This framework also predicts overlapping mental health outcomes of IM across human groups, with unique interactions between social-contextual influences and individual differences (e.g. neurodivergent traits) that determine how IM manifests and affects mental health. Leveraging this framework can address a critical knowledge gap: Are the mental health impacts of camouflaging and their social-contextual underpinnings in the general population parallel to, or different from, recent findings in autism-enriched samples (Field et al., 2024;�Zhuang et al., 2023)?","Camouflaging, internalized stigma, and mental health in the general population"
725,"How do the mental health repercussions of camouflaging in autistic individuals, such as depression, anxiety, diminished self-esteem, felt inauthenticity, and burnout, impact their overall well-being and quality of life?","Camouflaging involves concealing or adapting neurodivergent (e.g. autistic) characteristics in social situations, such as imitating body language, memorizing social scripts, and maintaining eye contact (Cook et al., 2021;�Libsack et al., 2021;�Zhuang et al., 2023). Social sanctions and prejudice that pervade neurotypical social spaces thwart opportunities for positive social contact and employment in autistic people (Cage & Troxell-Whitman, 2019;�Hull et al., 2017;�Mandy, 2019). Hence, some hide their neurodivergence (i.e. deviations in neurocognitive profiles from the general population ?normal?) for safety, belonging, and control over the impressions they form in others (Zhuang et al., 2023). Nevertheless, the mental health repercussions can be substantial. Growing research and lived experiences from autistic people suggest that camouflaging can trigger depression, anxiety, diminished self-esteem, felt inauthenticity, and burnout (Cook et al., 2021;�Field et al., 2024).","Camouflaging, internalized stigma, and mental health in the general population"
726,"How do the findings regarding the associations between camouflaging, self-presentation, and mental health in the general population relate to the experiences of autistic individuals in particular, and what role does internalized stigma play in these relationships?","Both camouflaging and self-presentation (a key component of impression management) were associated with mental health presentations in the general population, which overlapped with those previously reported in autistic people. These associations were more pronounced in women compared with men and were of different directions for individuals with higher autistic traits versus higher ADHD traits. Internalized stigma might be a key stressor that could elicit camouflaging and impression management through social anxiety, which in turn might lead to adverse mental health outcomes.","Camouflaging, internalized stigma, and mental health in the general population"
727,How do gender and neurodivergent traits influence the ways in which individuals in the general population camouflage and manage impressions while experiencing mental health repercussions?,"We first examined whether individuals in the general population camouflage and manage impressions while experiencing mental health repercussions, and how gender and neurodivergent traits modified these associations. We then assessed how camouflaging and impression management arose from internalized stigma, and their inter-relationships in shaping mental health outcomes.","Camouflaging, internalized stigma, and mental health in the general population"

758,Can you provide more information on the specific challenges and limitations faced when using computational techniques and evaluations for collecting and processing online written data to infer psychological well-being and detect common mental disorders in marginalized individuals?,"There is also potential for the future application of ML and natural language processing (NLP) approaches to infer psychological well-being and detect CMDs in marginalized individuals based on social media posts on platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Researchers must implement diagnostic criteria and tools that are precise and suitable for various online populations. Personal information, such as sociodemographic characteristics and behavioral aspects, must be collected by ethical considerations. These inferences can create online platforms that provide health information, support, and tailored interventions. Currently, the computational techniques and evaluations employed for collecting, processing, and utilizing online written data remain scattered throughout academic literature [62]. Moreover, this potential is limited by factors such as class imbalance, noisy labels, and text samples that are either too long or too short, which can lead to performance and stability issues. The diversity of writing styles and semantic heterogeneity in different data sources can also cause a lack of robustness in model performance. Standardizing these measures can allow for the development of scalable approaches for automated monitoring of public psychological health in the future [43].",Machine learning applications in studying mental health among immigrants and racial and ethnic minorities: an exploratory scoping review

760,How can the limited sample sizes in utilizing machine learning techniques for mental health classification impact the generalizability of the accuracy estimate of the classifier?,"One of the most common challenges in utilizing ML techniques to build classifiers for MH is the use of small sample sizes, which may limit the representation of the entire population and impact the generalizability of the classifier?s accuracy estimate. This can be a practical limitation due to resource constraints in real-world clinical or diagnostic settings. However, researchers need to understand that using ML alone cannot address this issue [26]. Most ML methods rely on supervised learning models, which are successful due to the abundance of training data. However, this training data requires human annotation, which can be time-consuming and costly. In the case of MH, there are insufficient publicly annotated datasets, making the quality of the data a significant concern for developing reliable models [53].",Machine learning applications in studying mental health among immigrants and racial and ethnic minorities: an exploratory scoping review

Biases can be mitigated through increased use of LLM training data that are more diverse in mental health. According to Kuzlu et al., with the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) through wearable devices, AI is becoming more popular [45]. However, cyberattackers are beginning to exploit the weaknesses of AI, known as generative adversarial AI, to carry out cybersecurity attacks [46,47,48,49]. The types of attacks can be categorized as poisoning (AI training data being intentionally tampered), evasion, extraction, and inference?slowing down AI adoption in the area of mental health [50,51]. However, not all adversarial AI is harmful, as this can also be used to train and leverage neural networks in guiding mental health treatment and prevention.

784,"What specific benefits can AI provide in mental health therapy sessions, and how does it differ from traditional therapy methods?","Mental health therapists have mixed opinions about the usage of AI in conducting therapy sessions. In 2024, the American Counseling Association (ACA) has an AI Working Group that they have convened in prioritizing client wellbeing. However, the ACA has warned that AI is not there to replace the therapist, due to the perception that this new technology can start replacing the role of the therapist. In a recent study, researchers found that in 20 scenarios, AI had increased emotional awareness compared to the general population?leading to the fear of replaced jobs [24]. For instance, in comparison to traditional mental health sessions, conversational agents can lead to improved control, choice, and interactivity over session content. While AI can be used for supplementally guide therapy sessions, practitioners cannot be solely relied for delivering therapy [33]. Current use of generative AI for conversational agents in mental health, as used in therapy sessions, has contradictory outcomes.

AI can not only improve diagnostic accuracy in many ways, but the technology can also aid in treatment. For diagnosis, researchers found that AI mental health solutions such as wearables can interpret bodily signals using sensors to offer help, instead of waiting for a user to interact. For instance, an individual that is experiencing an anxiety attack can use physiological changes to become aware of these changes to tailor AI-guided treatment for each individual. Utilizing sleeping patterns, physical activity, heart rate, and rhythm variability AI can be used to assess the user?s mood and cognitive state.

Large language models can be harnessed to create inexpensive tools that can be used to address these shortages [26,27]. With the aid of generative AI, complex treatment modalities can be used to better address psychiatric conditions. While most studies focus on the medical context of mental illness, what we investigated is how the popularity of AI in mental health is a reflection of AI literacy in the general public, especially in the area of mental health.",Mental Health Applications of Generative AI and Large Language Modeling in the United States
792,Can you provide more detail on how polypharmacy and lack of understanding contribute to medication nonadherence in mental health treatment?,"One of the hurdles that mental health professionals have to grapple with is the lack of adherence to medications. There are many reasons for medication nonadherence, such as fear of potential side effects, lack of disease acceptance, and lack of awareness of not taking the medication regularly. Also, polypharmacy due to comorbid chronic diseases can be another deterrent for medication adherence due to lack of understanding or poor patient?physician communication. Additionally, the lack of current efficacious mental disorder treatments leads to higher nonadherence rates. However, the consequences of medication nonadherence can have far-reaching consequences. For instance, there may be an increase in relapse or even exacerbation of mental health symptoms or even suicidal tendencies.",Mental Health Applications of Generative AI and Large Language Modeling in the United States
793,"What specific advancements in generative AI have been particularly effective in improving diagnostic methods for mental health disorders, as mentioned in the text?","Depression and anxiety remain major mental health and public health problems that are on the rise. In 2023, Canady et al. found [17] that there were approximately 29% of the population that have mental health problems. This increased by 10 percent from the year 2015. Staggering statistics have paved the way for novel technologies such as AI, a more comprehensive treatment modality. Additionally, according to a Gallup Panel [18], the 17.8% who either had a diagnosis or currently have been treated for depression is up from 2015. At the same time, the cost of depression has skyrocketed.

794,Can you explain more about how AI was used to reduce the number of questions in the Symptom Checklist-90 questionnaire to create the SCL-20-AI and how this impacted diagnostic accuracy in mental health assessment?,"Globally, mental health problems affect one in eight individuals [12]. Mental health is strongly connected to physical health, with large swaths of people becoming aware of the importance. Khubchandani et al. found [14] that depression is strongly intertwined with diabetes as it relates to poor outcomes. Banerjee et al. found [15] that social isolation, a byproduct of mental health, is also a predictor of overall mortality. One distinct way to diagnose mental health disorders is the 90-question Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90-R). Tutun et al. [10] found a way to leverage AI to address problems in diagnostic methods. However, the number of questions and the complexity of the SCL-90 questionnaire necessitates alternative AI-driven ways to maintain mental health diagnostic accuracy, even after the reduction in the number of questions, for instance, decreasing a 90-item questionnaire to a 28-item questionnaire (SCL-20-AI) without any human input, to an accuracy level of 89% [10]. Additionally, the researchers emphasized the importance of establishing close cooperation between the creators of AI-based decision support systems and mental health practitioners.",Mental Health Applications of Generative AI and Large Language Modeling in the United States

822,How did the authors in the study address the potential need for booster sessions to maintain treatment effects when ongoing stressors occur?,"In this Special Issue, two studies investigated the efficacy of a skills-based psychosocial intervention that adopted a task-shifting model to address psychological distress following climate change disasters. The Skills fOr Life Adjustment and Resilience (SOLAR) programme (O?Donnell et al.,�2020) was found to reduce psychological distress and posttraumatic stress symptoms in cyclone-affected communities in the Pacific Island nation of Tuvalu (Gibson et al.,�2021), relative to Usual Care. Similarly, the SOLAR programme was found to significantly reduce anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress symptoms relative to an active Self-Help condition in a sample of individuals affected by compound disasters in rural and regional Australia (Cowlishaw et al.,�2023). Interestingly, the findings from this randomised controlled trial highlighted the need to consider the cumulative events, with the authors suggesting booster sessions would be useful to maintain treatment effects when ongoing stressors occur. These findings highlight that flexible, scalable low-intensity psychosocial interventions delivered by laypeople could form a critical part of post-disaster recovery by allowing for more optimised allocation of mental health resources, so that the diverse mental health needs of individuals can be most effectively addressed. Importantly, the SOLAR programme provides skills to manage exposure to traumatic events, which as this editorial argues, is an essential part of understanding and addressing the mental health impacts of climate change.",Taking a trauma and adversity perspective to climate change mental health

The importance of social support, particularly from parents and caregivers, was echoed by a narrative review examining the potential impact of the Turkey?Syria earthquake on the psychological well-being of the affected children and adolescents (Khan et al.,�2023). The review also highlights the need for long-term mental health support services ? co-designed by affected communities, to ensure their cultural appropriateness and effectiveness and encourage help-seeking ? so that children and adolescents can receive ongoing mental health support after the initial acute disaster event.",Taking a trauma and adversity perspective to climate change mental health
824,I would like to know how the study mentioned in the text specifically assessed and measured the impact of childhood trauma on cognitive and biological functioning in children and adolescents exposed to natural disasters.,"Childhood and adolescence are critical developmental periods characterised by complex neurodevelopmental changes. Exposure to childhood trauma is associated with disruptions in normative cognitive and biological (i.e. genetic, neurodevelopmental, and hormonal) functioning that confer risk for psychiatric illness (McKay et al.,�2021). In this Special Issue, there was a particular focus on mechanisms that underpin the emergence and maintenance of mental health problems in children and adolescents exposed to climate change-related natural disasters. In a longitudinal study of Chinese children and adolescents exposed to the Zhouqu debris flow, Liang et al. (2023) identified that depressive symptoms were stable over the two-year study period, with feelings of self-hate, loneliness and sleep disturbance most central to the enduring experience of depression over time. Given the multifaceted developmental processes occurring in this period, it is notable that one study also found that the clinical expression of mental health responses to natural disasters diverged by age group. In children exposed to a violent storm in France (Richez et al.,�2022), acute stress responses amongst 0?5-year-olds were more typically characterised by agitation and developmental regression, whereas 6?11-year olds were more likely to report experiencing anxiety.",Taking a trauma and adversity perspective to climate change mental health
825,How do pre-existing vulnerabilities and post-disaster stressors interact to mediate the effects of climate change on mental health outcomes?,"A trauma lens also provides important information when considering who is vulnerable to poor mental health outcomes following the impacts of climate change. In a longitudinal study, Liang et al. (2023) found a cumulative, dose-related relationship between childhood trauma/stressful life events, and the later mental health response to disaster events. While social support had a buffering effect, this effect was not seen for those with a high stress load. It is also well demonstrated that there are demographic disparities that moderate the health effects of climate change (Benevolenza & DeRigne,�2019), particularly among vulnerable populations such as low-income individuals (Tekin et al.,�2023) and racial and ethnic minorities (Berberian et al.,�2022). Pertinently, in addition to individual pre-existing vulnerabilities, the financial stressors emerging directly from extreme disaster events are a core mediator between these events and their adverse mental health outcomes. For example, economic factors such as damage to homes and infrastructure, threats to livelihood and employment, and the associated financial stressors (Berry et al.,�2010,�2018; Hayes et al.,�2018) are all contributors to negative mental health outcomes beyond the direct effects of trauma exposure and physical danger (Zhang et al.,�2022). Accordingly, a trauma-informed perspective on the mental health outcomes of climate change must consider both pre-existing vulnerabilities and post-disaster stressors which mediate the effects of disasters and other climate change events.",Taking a trauma and adversity perspective to climate change mental health
826,"How do researchers categorize climate change-related disaster events and their mental health impacts, and why is it important to consider cumulative events in understanding the mental health effects of climate change?","When describing climate change-related events and their mental health impacts, researchers tend to categorise disaster events based on their time course or chronicity. For example, events have been labelled as�acute extreme weather events�that last for days such as wildfires, hurricanes and floods;�sub-acute events�that last for months such as droughts and heat waves; and�lasting environmental changes�such as sea level rises, and permanently altered environments (Palinkas & Wong,�2020). Similarly, disaster response frameworks often classify psychosocial interventions based on their position in time relative to a single emergency event ? i.e. addressing mental health symptoms in the aftermath of a disaster, versus building mental health preparedness and resilience for future disasters (Mrazek & Haggerty,�1994). While this way of categorising events is useful, a trauma-informed perspective would also have us recognise the importance of cumulative events. As the global effects of climate change continue to worsen, not only are natural disaster events increasing in frequency, communities are increasingly more likely to be impacted by multiple and overlapping disaster events (Cowlishaw et al.,�2023; Leppold et al.,�2022). In this Special Issue, Agyapong et al. (2022) found that the number of traumatic disasters experienced a five-year period (including COVID, wildfire and flood events) was associated with both the prevalence and severity of mental health conditions including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depression episode and generalised anxiety disorder. We can expect that the global burden of mental health problems will continue to escalate as the climate crisis worsens and cumulative disaster exposure becomes the norm, and that these impacts will be disproportionately felt by minority communities more directly affected by climate change (Pearson et al.,�2023). As such, there is a clear need for researchers, policy makers and disaster response agencies to consider the compounding mental health impacts of exposure to multiple or simultaneous climate change-related events and stressors.",Taking a trauma and adversity perspective to climate change mental health
827,"Can you provide examples of specific climate change-related events that have had a significant impact on mental health and well-being, as discussed in the text?","In recent years, there has been increasing attention devoted to understanding and mitigating the impacts of climate change on mental health (Berry et al.,�2010; Charlson et al.,�2021; Cianconi et al.,�2020; Doherty & Clayton,�2011; Olff,�2023). This attention is the result of the increasing frequency and severity of climate change-related events (Basu et al.,�2018; Edwards et al.,�2024; Thompson et al.,�2023) as well as the growing anxiety over the existential threat posed by climate change on human health and well-being to future generations (Heeren & Asmundson,�2023; Usher,�2022). The�European Journal of Psychotraumatology�has had a long interest in this issue (Olff,�2017,�2019) and in 2020 put out a call for studies advancing research in the area of climate change and traumatic stress (see Olff,�2022). The papers included in this special issue of the�European Journal of Psychotraumatology�draw from, and contribute to, a trauma-informed perspective on this topic. The central theme of this special issue is that trauma and adversity are central to our understanding of the mental health impacts of climate change. In this editorial, we argue that taking a trauma focus to this understanding is essential in order to evolve our thinking of resilience and recovery.",Taking a trauma and adversity perspective to climate change mental health
828,Can you provide more examples of how deep learning can be used in geriatric mental health treatment and prevention?,"As reviewed here, geriatric mental health can be understood using insights from deep learning. Software using deep learning offers options in mental health treatment and prevention. As we state in the Introduction, the potential for ethical challenges and bias in deep learning approaches must be considered in parallel with its potential. The risks are many and include inequitable representation of populations in data used for training models, inadequate protections of data privacy, the possibility that repurposing existing data for developing deep learning algorithms exceeds the scope of the informed consent for the original gathering of data, the potential for loss of confidentiality, and the potential for deep learning approaches being used for profitability55. Many of these risks have been identified in domains of medicine such as radiology and oncology where the application of deep learning is more developed. The complexities of behavioral health combined with cognitive impairment frequently seen in late life raises the potential for even more complex ethical questions. These must be acknowledged transparently and addressed directly to maintain trust in these tools as they evolve.",Deep Learning and Geriatric Mental Health
829,Can you provide examples of how deep learning can be integrated with Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA) in geriatric mental health?,"Deep learning is a rapidly growing field and has much potential for impact in geriatric mental health beyond what we reviewed here. There are other somatic treatment approaches we did not discuss (e.g., neurostimulation) as well as additional behavioral interventions. For instance, there is the opportunity for integration of deep learning with Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA). ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com/chat) and other large language models are based on the same DL approach discussed here. ChatGPT can provide very useful guidance on a wide range of topics. However, it uses generative AI, which involves synthetic data, and thus it can also make up things that are not true.",Deep Learning and Geriatric Mental Health
830,"Can you explain how natural language processing is being utilized as a potential biomarker for Alzheimer's risk and late-life depression, and how this technology can contribute to personalized health interventions?","There are several research groups examining natural language processing (NLP) and automated speech analysis in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer?s disease to see if NLP can be used as a biomarker for Alzheimer?s risk. It is also a potential marker for late-life depression42?45. An NLP method was developed that recognized both behavioral activation and depressive symptoms in numerous texts exchanged among patients and therapists; behavioral activation may serve as a mediator of change in depression in patients receiving psychotherapies�46. GPS mobility data has been identified as a digital biomarker for negative symptoms in schizophrenia�47,48, and there are several other examples. Ultimately, the insights derived from passive sensing data can enable personalized health interventions and real-time behavior monitoring systems.",Deep Learning and Geriatric Mental Health
831,Can you provide more information on how deep learning approaches have been used in monitoring and tracking cognitive changes in older adults for geriatric mental health research?,"Deep learning applied to passive sensing data has numerous practical applications in geriatric mental health research, such as gait analysis and fall detection, emotion detection, suicide prediction, monitoring and tracking cognitive changes, health monitoring, sleep analysis, social engagement, and much more. Furthermore, deep learning approaches have been applied to sensor data with the ability to map motion. This has included a range of sensors, including infrared motion sensors, sensors on doors, sleeping mat sensors, wearable actigraphs, cameras, and radio-wave based sensors33?37. A growing body of literature demonstrates how this approach has proven effective for a number of precise clinical applications in dementia care. This ranges from detecting activated behaviors such as agitation, passive behaviors such as apathy, tracking the therapeutic impact of medications such as antidepressants and antipsychotics, and monitoring the side effects of these medications. Applications also include the detection of falls and fall risk based on gait analysis. In the broader domain of neurodegenerative disorders, applying deep learning to motion detection has been demonstrated as a marker for early detection and diagnosis of Parkinson?s disease38. This approach has significant potential implications for developing early behavioral markers for Alzheimer?s disease, since behavioral impairments can manifest years before cognitive impairment39.",Deep Learning and Geriatric Mental Health
832,"As a student interested in the implications of AI advancements on mental health, I would like elaboration on how Noam Chomsky's distinction between ChatGPT and human language relates to the impact of AI on psychology and mental health.","There are, however, crucial difference. For example, Noam Chomsky, the father of computational linguistics recently described the distinction between ChatGPT and human language. Chomsky and colleagues describe that these large language models do not model the current state the way people do. Rather they focus on superficial associations. This is a key distinction between human and artificial intelligence. Chomsky demonstrated that languages and machines are essentially identical. A simple Chomsky normal form grammar is equivalent to a push down automata15. The mathematical proofs highlight the use of a small number of ?hidden? states as a canonical framework for representing language. ChatGPT and other large language models use a different approach that is more brute force for modeling language. They learn by estimating superficial associations between many features, rather than using a hidden state-based model. The current AI is based on what Chomsky describes as a superficial model of causality; therefore he does not see it as competing with human intelligence.",Deep Learning and Geriatric Mental Health
833,How does the concept of Deep Learning differ from the traditional computer model in shaping our understanding of the human mind?,"Societal understanding of computer processing has had profound impacts on our current ?theory of mind.? People understand themselves with computer analogies, e.g., short and long-term memory like a computer28. Deep Learning provides a more creative and flexible framework than the traditional computer model and can profoundly change ?theory of mind?.",Deep Learning and Geriatric Mental Health
834,"As a student interested in the intersection of AI and mental health, I would like to know more about the complexities involved in determining the sample size needed for developing effective deep learning predictive models in the context of geriatric psychiatry.","In general, it is not currently possible to determine the sample size needed to obtain a well-performing deep learning predictive model in the same way that one can compute the required sample size for estimating and testing effects under a hypothesis testing framework. Application of deep learning or any machine learning methods in geriatric psychiatry will likely require the learning of complex relationships between features derived from multiple modalities (e.g., behavioral, environmental, genetic, imaging). Having the ?right? data to begin with is obviously extremely important. If one is not measuring features that are relevant for predicting responses, then neither a large sample size nor an optimal deep learning or machine learning algorithm will lead to predictions that are of any clinical relevance. We direct reader to reviews of deep learning methods and their applications in psychiatry, with detailed discussions about sample size considerations by Koppe 2019 and Koppe 202122,23. (Table)",Deep Learning and Geriatric Mental Health
835,How does the assumption that the set of possible algorithms is countable impact the development and understanding of AI algorithms in relation to mental health applications?,"The math behind computing theory relies on the assumption that the set of possible algorithms is theoretically countable , as opposed to an infinity that is so large it cannot be counted. In this case, countable means that we can explicitly describe the steps of the algorithm (sometimes referred to as the ?machine?). As long as we can describe these steps, we can classify and organize them. This assumption has also been applied to neuroscience and is the basis for models of how circuits within the brain may operate. For a much deeper dive into these principles, we direct readers to the influential 1979 Pulitzer Prize winning book on the subject,�Godel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid�written by D. Hofstadtler17.",Deep Learning and Geriatric Mental Health
836,Can you provide examples of how generative AI can be helpful in certain contexts despite its potential to generate fabricated results?,"Because generative AI is creating new examples, it can be seen to learn deep associations that we would not expect. With images it can create realistic faces of no one in particular. In large language models it may make up a reference for a study that does not exist. The AI gives the closest answer it can come up with for the question, which might be a fabricated reference14. The fabrications are sometimes referred to as a type of AI hallucination. These fabricated results in generative AI are expected and reflect the depth of the model. In the appropriate context, the fabrications are very helpful. However, if used naively, generative AI can easily be misleading.",Deep Learning and Geriatric Mental Health
837,"Can you provide more detail on why large sample sizes are necessary for fitting deep learning models in clinical scenarios, and how this relates to the challenges in geriatric psychiatry research?","As noted above, one of the very attractive features of deep learning models is that they are highly flexible. That is, they are able to capture more detail (or nuances) of a concept, like the detail in a realistic face. This flexibility is due to the extremely large number parameters, potentially numbering in the millions, that define them. In clinical scenarios, fitting such models typically requires very large sample sizes. However, in geriatric psychiatry research, large sample sizes are just not that common ? owing to a number of factors (e.g., the complexity of collecting data from geriatric patients, the time-consuming effort needed for preprocessing neuroimaging data, etc.).",Deep Learning and Geriatric Mental Health
838,Could you explain the concept of deep learning and how it differs from traditional machine learning in the context of distinguishing dogs from non-dogs using images as input data?,"Rather than using a list of derived features, deep learning, can also take as its input, for example, images of dogs and non-dogs and learn features that can be used to distinguish dogs from non-dogs. Unlike traditional machine learning, where the learner is explicitly provided with features, in this case characteristics of the animal, the deep learning approach can extract features from the raw image data. It uses the images, rather than the extracted features. This is achieved through the use of deep (highly parameterized and flexible) networks of artificial neuron-like units. The connection strengths (i.e., weights, which are akin to slopes in regression models) between the units are adjusted to make the network improve its ability to correctly classify an image as a dog or non-dog from each labeled example.",Deep Learning and Geriatric Mental Health
839,Can you explain how deep learning differs from traditional machine learning in terms of feature selection and why this difference is important for allowing deep learning algorithms to automatically learn features from raw data?,"Deep learning can also be distinguished from more traditional machine learning approaches by how it does feature selection. Traditional machine learning typically uses already pre-processed, or selected features. This can require manual selection of features (i.e., feature engineering). This entails experts identifying and extracting meaningful features for the algorithm to learn. Deep learning, when it works, is able to leverage the power of ANNs to automatically learn features and hierarchies of features from the raw data. This property of generating new data-driven features can be contrasted with manual feature engineering that is used more commonly in traditional machine learning. New advances using deep learning include Generative Adversarial Networks7, which play a key role in deepfakes8�, and multi-head attention9�(the transformer), which underlies large language models like ChatGPT�10�.",Deep Learning and Geriatric Mental Health
840,Can you explain in more detail the connection between deep learning and better prediction accuracy in supervised learning tasks within artificial neural networks?,"However, foundational to deep learning is the concept of the Artificial neural network (ANN). ANNs are machine learning models that are designed to emulate the human brain and are characterized by one or more layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that generate non-linear representations of the input features which are useful for supervised, unsupervised, or semi-supervised problems. Deep learning simply corresponds to those ANNs with multiple layers of interconnected nodes. In the context of supervised learning, fitting ANN models with more layers (i.e., deeper models) has the potential to lead to better prediction accuracy and this is one of the main reasons that deep learning has recently received considerable attention.",Deep Learning and Geriatric Mental Health
841,"How does supervised learning in machine learning specifically impact the prediction and diagnosis of mental health conditions, such as depression or dementia, using clinical data?","Supervised learning typically falls into one of two categories: regression, when the outcome is numerical (e.g., depression score), or classification, when the outcome is a class label or group membership (e.g., type of dementia)4. The machine learning program uses these labeled examples to train a model (i.e., a type of prediction algorithm) that can be used to predict outcomes for new observations (observations not previously seen by the algorithm). This basic model is used for finding patterns in, for example, images, in patient clinical data, and from internet searches that are useful in predicting outcomes of interest. For instance, learning to predict the age of the patient based on their brain MRI, from seeing many examples of brain MRIs labeled with the age of each individual. In traditional machine learning, the algorithm finds a concise expression of the features, such as a decision tree, to describe how to classify new examples.",Deep Learning and Geriatric Mental Health
842,"As a student fascinated by the implications of advancements in AI on mental health, I would like to know more about the specific ethical challenges that arise in the field of deep learning and AI and how they may impact mental health.","At the very outset, it is critical to acknowledge that in an emerging field like deep learning that relies on gathering vast amounts of data, there are certain to be complex ethical questions. The full scope of these challenges is unlikely to be understood at this time and a comprehensive discussion of the ethics of deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI) is beyond the scope of this review. We discuss this further in the Future Directions section",Deep Learning and Geriatric Mental Health
843,The text mentions the importance of ensuring ethical development and use of AI tools in clinical settings. Can you provide more information on the potential ethical considerations that arise with the use of deep learning in geriatric mental health care?,"Our intent in this review is to provide an overview and perspective on the clinical use of an especially compelling branch of AI ? deep learning. We are currently experiencing a ?deep learning revolution?2. In this revolution, computers have become so good at finding patterns in big data that solutions are being found for questions we did not know we had. For instance, using the popular smart-phone app made by iNaturalist (https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/seek_app) one can now point their phone at a plant or animal to identify the species. However, multiple critical questions remain unanswered, including where the most useful applications of these tools may be, what steps need to be taken to ensure ethical development and use of these tools (including the data used to create them), and what regulatory frameworks may be necessary. The process of answering these questions will call for unprecedented dialogue and collaboration between fields and experts who may not typically collaborate ? including patients, clinicians, data scientists, data visualization and design experts, ethicists, and regulators. A field like geriatric mental health which is inherently proficient at working with interdisciplinary perspective is thus ideally placed to lead this process.",Deep Learning and Geriatric Mental Health
844,How can advancements in AI potentially impact the field of geriatric psychiatry and the complex process of providing care for older adults with mental health issues?,"Geriatric psychiatry is a study of human and medical complexity. Mental health in late-life represents the cumulative outcome of a number of factors that include changes to the brain (both age-related and pathological), changes in the body, evolving social circumstances, and psychological factors (both protective and detrimental). It can be impacted by biological determinants present at birth (e.g., genetic risks) and highly situational circumstances (e.g., bereavement). Moreover, there is growing recognition that treatment outcomes can be quite heterogeneous, many factors can impact medication response and successful psychotherapy requires tailoring. The process of providing care in this domain is thus immersed in complexity.",Deep Learning and Geriatric Mental Health
845,How can machine learning techniques be utilized to differentiate individuals with Parkinson's disease from those with other conditions and healthy controls based on various biomarkers?,"A current limitation of these studies is that there are a limited number of reports focusing on various biomarkers, thus potential variability in outcome based on metrics and machine learning techniques is still an issue. Future directions of these studies should involve applying machine learning techniques to a variety of biomarkers to distinguish subjects with PD from APs and HC.",The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms
846,How do machine learning techniques specifically contribute to minimizing misdiagnoses and reducing wait time for proper diagnosis in dystonia and essential tremor?,"In dystonia, differences in accuracy have been observed when comparing the application of machine learning to the lack of machine learning. This suggests that misdiagnoses and wait time for proper diagnosis can be minimized through machine and deep learning techniques [33,45]. Research in ET suggests that machine learning techniques may be able to determine which metrics contribute to disease pathology, however larger sample sizes are necessary to gain insight into whether machine learning techniques can be used [46,47]. The significantly low specificity reported by Sacc� et al. may be attributed to the low sample size, but the researchers additionally acknowledged that the algorithm used may not have been able to detect subtle differences in functional connectivity between ET subjects and HC. Additional research comparing which machine learning techniques provide accurate results for an analysis is essential so that appropriate techniques and data can be applied to diagnosis of APs and PD.",The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms
847,"How was the performance of the DystoniaBoTXNet model evaluated in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC on the different independent test sets?","A similar article on dystonia investigated the use of machine and deep learning to predict the efficacy of BoTX in four types of dystonia [45]. As treatment efficacy differs based on the symptoms and dysfunction a patient experiences and what a treatment addresses, machine learning could be invaluable in determining the best treatment for a patient. A deep learning algorithm was created (DystoniaBoTXNet) to differentiate subjects with dystonia who benefited from BoTX (n�=�173) from subjects with dystonia who did not benefit from BoTX (n�=�82). The training included 106 BoTX-benefiting subjects and 59 BoTX-non-benefiting subjects, who all had laryngeal dystonia. Three independent test sets were used to evaluate DystoniaBoTXNet. The first independent test set had 29 BoTX-benefiting subjects and 15 BoTX-non-benefiting subjects, all with laryngeal dystonia and the second independent test set had 38 BoTX-benefiting subjects and 8 BoTX-non-benefiting subjects, with blepharospasm, cervical dystonia, or writer's cramp. The third independent test set had 29 BoTX-na�ve subjects to predict whether these subjects would benefit from BoTX. No feature selection algorithms were implemented; feature extraction was included in the DystoniaBoTXNet framework. The number of features was not reported. DystoniaBoTXNet achieved accuracy of 94.9�%, AUC of 93.8�%, sensitivity of 100�%, and specificity of 84.6�% in the first independent set. When the second independent test set was applied, DystoniaBoTXNet achieved accuracy of 97.7�%, AUC of 92.4�%, sensitivity of 100�%, and specificity of 87.5�%. The performance of the model in this independent set shows that the DystoniaBoTXNet framework is generalizable. Of the 29 subjects in the third independent test set, 7 of them received BoTX. DystoniaBoTXNet had predicted that all 7 subjects would experience a benefit; 5 subjects benefited, and 2 subjects did not benefit. The median probability that the subjects would benefit that the model reported for the 5 subjects who benefited was 99.99�%, whereas the median probability was 90.8�% for the 2 false positive subjects. Overall, DystoniaBoTXNet achieved an accuracy of 96.3�%, with a sensitivity, specificity, and referral rate of 100�%, 86.1�%, and 7.8�% respectively (see�Table 3) [45].",The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms
848,"How do machine learning techniques, such as deep learning algorithms, play a role in identifying biomarkers for movement disorders like dystonia and essential tremor from structural MRI data, and how does this contribute to improving diagnostics in these conditions?","The capacity of machine learning techniques in diagnostics is also evident in other movement disorders. Movement disorders such as dystonia and essential tremor have shown promise in the application of machine learning techniques. Research in these movement disorders was reviewed to analyze these results (n�=�3). For instance, Valeriani and Simonyan [33] created a deep learning algorithm to identify a microstructural neural network biomarker from structural MRI data and classify participants as either dystonia subjects (n�=�329) or HC (n�=�220). Prior research has shown that 50�% of dystonia cases are misdiagnosed; specific biomarkers for dystonia are not easy to obtain as whole-brain changes are observed over the disease course.",The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms
849,"Can you explain in more detail how machine learning was utilized in the study to assess white matter changes in PSP, PD, and HC subjects?","Nigro et al. [32] applied track density imaging to assess white matter changes between PSP subjects (n�=�67), PD subjects (n�=�36), and HC (n�=�37) using a machine learning-based model. The researchers did not mention any cross-validation techniques or differences between training and test sample, which may have caused overfitting. In PSP-P subjects (n�=�31), when compared to HC and PD subjects, decreased track density was reported in the cerebellum, midbrain, superior cerebellar peduncle, and corticospinal tract. The whole-brain model created from track density metrics was able to distinguish PSP-P subjects from PD subjects with an AUC of 0.90 and PSP-RS subjects (n�=�36) from PD subjects with an AUC of 0.94. When the model was restricted to the superior cerebellar peduncle, the AUC, when distinguishing PSP-RS from PD, rose to 0.96, while the AUC decreased to 0.86 when distinguishing PSP-P from PD [32]. This suggests that fewer differences are present between PD and PSP-P than between PD and PSP-RS within the superior cerebellar peduncle (see�Table 3). Similarly, researchers creating a model using T1-weighted MRI reported differences in the midbrain, thalamus, pons, and corpus callosum between PD (n�=�28) and PSP (n�=�28) subjects [34]. PCA was used for feature extraction, and LOOCV was used during the model training process. The model generated to differentiate PSP and PD subjects exhibited high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity (88.9�%, 89.5�%, and 88.5�%, respectively). Additionally, when differentiating PSP subjects and HC (n�=�28), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were slightly higher (89.1�%, 89.5�%, and 89.1�%, respectively) (see�Table 3) [34]. This indicates that MRI can be applied in differentiating types of parkinsonism and diagnosing APs.",The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms
850,How did the performance of the artificial neural network (ANN) compare to the shallow pipeline model (SVM) in differentiating between atypical parkinsonian syndromes (APs) and Parkinson's disease (PD) using DAT-SPECT imaging?,"Chien et al. [26] created an ANN to differentiate APs (including MSA, PSP, spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), vascular parkinsonism, and other causes of parkinsonism) (n�=�122) from PD (n�=�140) using DAT-SPECT imaging. Approximately 90�% of the initial set of subjects (n�=�205) were used to train the model, and the final 10�% was used for validation. The model was tested using an external dataset, with 22 PD and 35 APs subjects, and PCA was used for feature extraction and selection. The ANN reported an AUC of 0.76, accuracy of 86.0�%, a sensitivity of 81.8�%, and a specificity of 88.6�% when specifically using the striatal region in the model. This was compared with a shallow pipeline (SVM), which reported an accuracy of 68.4�%, sensitivity of 31.8�%, and specificity of 91.4�%. When the ANN was assessed using whole-brain imaging, the accuracy and specificity decreased (68.4�% and 60.0�%) [26]. The researchers did not specify what specific APs were included in the external dataset; it is possible that DAT-SPECT imaging may have differences in performance when PD and MSA/PSP are differentiated compared to when PD and other types of parkinsonisms (see�Table 3).",The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms
851,Can you elaborate on how the model's performance in distinguishing subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD) differed from its performance in distinguishing subjects with atypical parkinsonian syndromes (APs)?,"Song et al. [44] defined a model to distinguish subjects with PD (n�=�551) from those with APs (n�=�222). Specifically, subjects with progressive supranuclear palsy ? Richardson's syndrome (PSP ? RS) (n�=�38), multiple system atrophy ? cerebellar subtype (MSA ? C) (n�=�71), and ataxia (n�=�113) were included under the APs group. About 80�% of the dataset was used for 4-fold cross-validation (split in 3:1 ratio). To evaluate performance, the remaining 20�% was prepared for independent hold-out validation, where the data was randomly partitioned into four parts and validation was performed 4 times. In the final model, holdout cross-validation was performed with the last 20�% instead. The model reported high AUC and specificity, but lower sensitivity, which suggests that the model was moderately reliable (average AUC of 0.971���0.028, average sensitivity of 73.6���17.9�%, and average specificity of 94.6���3.3�%). A confidence interval was not specified. Given the standard deviation for sensitivity, between 306 and 504 of 551 PD subjects were accurately classified. In comparison, between 202 and 217 of 222 APs subjects were accurately classified. Based on this, the model was reliable at classifying subjects with APs, but had worse performance when classifying PD subjects. It is important to note that the accuracy of diagnosis performed by nonspecialists with a variety of clinical presentations (including PD and APs) was 73.8�%, so it is possible that the model created by this study may be used as a supplement (see�Table 2).",The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms

853,Can you explain how the hidden Markov model (HMM) structure was used to identify the eight disease stages of Parkinson's Disease in this study?,"A model created by Severson et al. [43] used clinical metrics such as tremors, bradykinesias, and neuropsychiatric measures to define and identify disease stages in PD. Five-fold cross-validation was applied to the training data (n�=�333), and the testing data included 83 subjects. No feature selection techniques were implemented. The model, created using the hidden Markov model (HMM) structure, identified eight disease stages of PD. This research suggests that AI and machine learning techniques may be used to recognize and separate disease stages and severity through clinical measures, and that these technologies may be applied to the diagnosis of movement disorders and prediction of worsening symptoms (see�Table 2).",The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms
854,How did the researchers evaluate the performance of the machine learning models in distinguishing stages of Parkinson's disease progression?,"A number of studies (n�=�4) have investigated the use of machine learning techniques to differentiate stages of disease progression of PD. For instance, Schalkamp et al. [41] created five different models from genetic, lifestyle, blood biochemistry, prodromal, and accelerometric biomarkers to distinguish prodromal PD (n�=�113) from established PD (n�=�153). The researchers implemented nested five-fold cross-validation with a five-fold split for the inner and outer split. About 168 features were used to train and test the models; no feature selection methods were reported. The accelerometric model outperformed the other four models with an AUC of 0.84���0.04 when trained on the general population. Additionally, when the accelerometric data was applied to differentiate prodromal PD and established PD from HC, the model achieved mean AUCs of 0.86���0.06 and 0.74���0.04, respectively. A 95�% confidence interval was used to compare different models. Further, this study created a model combining the most predictive features of the initial five models, which performed similar to the accelerometric model. As accelerometric data records movement during sleep, this study suggests that including accelerometry in further prediction may supplement prodromal data in the prediction of PD onset (see�Table 4) [41].",The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms
855,Can you explain more about how feature selection was performed on the training set and how many neuroimaging-based features were ultimately retained for the model?,"Similarly, a study combined neuroimaging data in the thalamic subnuclei and clinical motor data (UPDRS III and presence of motor symptoms) to distinguish PD subjects (n�=�131) from HC (n�=�69) [28]. 70�% of the data was used for the training set, and the other 30�% was used for the test set. Additionally, five-fold cross-validation was used to train the model. At least 100 features were extracted from the data, so feature selection was performed on the training set. 11 clinical features and an unreported number of neuroimaging-based features were retained. When these features were used, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC values were 95�%, 97.44�%, 90.48�%, and 0.9756 (see�Table 4) [28].",The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms
856,"Can you explain further how the researchers used five-fold cross-validation in training the models, and how this process helped to improve the accuracy of the CNN in differentiating PD subjects from HC?","A similar study aimed to apply a CNN to differentiate PD subjects (n�=�115) from HC (n�=�115) [40]. The researchers explored the efficacy of the CNN on four different diffusion analyses (diffusion tensor imaging-weighted (DTI-weighted); diffusion kurtosis imaging-weighted (DKI-weighted); neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging-weighted; and g-ratio-weighted connectome matrices) in differentiation. It is known that DKI is an extension of DTI, involving additional properties of water diffusion. Machine learning-based models that involve multiple contributing variables (such as the DKI model) tend to perform better than models that are based on fewer characteristics. The researchers used five-fold cross-validation in the process of training the models. The reported AUC values based on the best metric from each analysis were 0.733, 0.895, 0.801, and 0.836. Their finding that the DKI model achieved the highest AUC supports that diagnostic models should use multiple biomarkers to ensure validity and accuracy [40]. However, as each diffusion analysis may have multiple features extracted from it, it is important to use a feature selection algorithm to reduce error and improve model performance. The researchers did not mention the number of features extracted or whether a feature selection was applied (see�Table 3).",The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms
857,"How did the researchers in the study use machine learning techniques, specifically decision tree modeling, to differentiate between Parkinson's Disease (PD) subjects and healthy controls based on finger movement data while typing?","Another study, which focused on finger movement data while typing, found that PD subjects (n�=�48) had lower typing frequency and velocity compared to HC (n�=�49), and that typing error and repetition rates were significantly higher in PD subjects' more affected hands compared to their less affected hands [37]. No feature selection techniques were reported, but based on the features reported by the researchers, there were only 9 features. When this data was used to create a machine learning model using the decision tree technique, it was able to distinguish PD from controls with an accuracy of 70�%, sensitivity of 77�%, and specificity of 65�%. No confidence interval was reported. It's possible that the model accuracy reported by the researchers does not reflect the utility of typing data, as models created using cross-validation techniques [17] show high accuracy metric values (see�Table 2). It is important to note that no training or testing sets were created from the data sample, indicating that the same data were used to train and test. Purk et al. [38] proposed a model using the Parkinson's Disease Non-Motor Scale (PDNMS) and spiral drawing tasks (which were drawn on a touchscreen tablet) to evaluate motor symptoms more objectively. The study consisted of three comparisons: PD (n�=�24) - HC (n�=�27), movement disorder (including APs, tremor, ataxias, multiple sclerosis, and essential tremor) (MD) (n�=�26) - HC, and PD-MD [38]. The results included accuracies for each model (PDNMS, spiral-drawing tasks, ensemble model) in each comparison (PD-HC: 88.2�%, 84.5�%, and 94�%, respectively; MD-HC: 77.7�%, 68.8�%, and 89.4�%, respectively; PD-MD: 60.0�%, 70.0�%, and 72�%, respectively) [38]. The researchers implemented stratified five-fold cross-validation. No confidence interval was reported. As there were 13 features extracted from the patient data, no feature selection was necessary to reduce error and chance of overfitting. A feature importance analysis was completed for each comparison, showing that for the PD-HC and MD-HC comparisons, the most important predictor was the number of questions answered with ?yes? on the PDNMS [38]. All three comparisons showed increased accuracy when both metrics were included in the model, suggesting both that the combination of different metrics assists in diagnosis, and that AI increases the accuracy of models (see�Table 2).",The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms
858,Can you explain more about the potential impact of overfitting on the diagnostic models created by Yu et al. [35] and how it could have affected the accuracy of the results?,"A number of studies (n�=�8) have explored the broad use of artificial intelligence (AI) to detect and differentiate PD symptoms. Specifically, previous studies have explored the capacity of non-motor clinical data to improve on diagnostic models. Yu et al. [35] created a model combining data from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and non-motor clinical aspects (such as olfactory data) that distinguished HC (n�=�138) and PD subjects (n�=�290). However, the researchers did not report any use of training or testing set, cross-validation, or independent set testing. This indicates that the models were tested on the same data they were trained on, which may have caused overfitting and/or erroneous model performance. When differentiating PD subjects from HC, the model combining the UPSIT scale (a clinical metric for olfactory data) with CSF data (specifically concentration of alpha-synuclein) reported a significant increase in AUC, sensitivity, and specificity compared to when CSF scores were used alone (AUC of 0.927, sensitivity of 89.7�%, and specificity of 80.4�%, as compared to AUC of 0.5982, sensitivity of 42.8�%, and specificity of 76.6�%). Based on the minimal difference in accuracy metrics between the combined and UPSIT-based models, the addition of alpha-synuclein did not have much of an impact on model performance. However, the combined model showed a noticeable decrease in specificity, which suggests that the addition of alpha-synuclein led to more subjects being classified as PD (regardless of whether they were PD or HC subjects) (see�Table 4).",The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms
859,"Can you explain the difference between a simple neural network and a deep neural network, and how their complexity impacts their ability to solve complex problems?","The simplest neural network (NN) or artificial neural network (ANN) uses a feed-forward nature, where information flows in one direction. When an input is entered, the input is passed to all nodes in each layer. It is most powerful in complex problem solving, including prediction analysis, and it can work with incomplete data. While simple NNs typically have 0?3 hidden layers with an output layer, deep neural networks can contain hundreds of hidden layers, which contribute to the complexity of the model. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are a type of ANNs that are suited specifically for image processing. While each input from an image into an ANN is an individual pixel and connections between pixels are lost, CNNs can pass parts of images to specific nodes (convolutional filters) instead of all nodes, so spatial features and connections are accounted for [17]. Radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN) are rarer than CNNs and ANNs and use radial basis functions as the activation function. As these functions are skilled at prediction, RBFNNs tend to train faster than other neural networks [25]. CNNs and ANNs can be used in conjunction for image analysis. One application of this is deep learning. First, convolutional filters from deep CNNs are used to note features of interest on a feature map, which can be passed as an input for the next layer. This process repeats until a final feature map can be created and passed into an ANN to classify the image based on the extracted features. This process can be applied for both image classification and segmentation [17]. Neural networks and deep learning algorithms can handle large amounts of data with high dimensionality better than SVM. Both SVMs and NNs have utility depending on what type of data is being analyzed.",The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms
860,How does the use of decision trees and random forests in supervised learning relate to the prediction and classification of mental health conditions in individuals?,"A decision tree is a method of supervised learning that is primarily used for classification problems but can also be used for regression. Beginning with a set of data, a decision tree uses the input variable that is best to split the data into the output classes and uses this variable to split the data into subsets. This decision can either lead to another decision to split the data further or to a set of data that predicts the class. Random forests are an extension of decision trees where a subset of the input variables is used to create different decision trees, and the majority vote from these trees is used to generate a classification [17]. One subtype of decision trees is a gradient-boosting decision tree, such as XGBoost or CatBoost. The main difference between gradient-boosting decision trees and decision trees is that while the decision tree aggregates group results at the end of the process, the gradient-boosting decision tree aggregates results after each step and determines error to correct for error in the next step using a loss function. This approach reduces bias and variance [21].",The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms
861,"How does the application of a generalized linear model in predicting the progression of movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, demonstrate the potential benefits of machine learning in healthcare outcomes and patient care?","Linear regression is the simplest machine learning technique and uses existing data to plot a linear relationship between two or more variables. Because of this, this technique is best for continuous data that follows a linear relationship. Logistic regression is similar to linear regression. Logistic regression is mainly used in application to discrete variables and classification and uses a sigmoidal curve to estimate probability [17]. A general linear model or generalized linear model (GLM) is a machine learning technique that performs multiple linear regressions to determine the output along with statistical methods such as ANOVA and the two-sample�t-test [18]. This technique has been frequently applied to movement disorders, including PD, for statistical analysis. For instance, Wang et al. [19] applied a multivariate GLM to predict the longitudinal progression of MDS UPDRS I and MDS UPDRS II scores. This analysis reported an area under the receiving operator characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.996, with improved performance when using MDS-UPDRS scores. Additionally, Fereshtehnejad et al. [20] performed a cluster analysis along with a GLM to group PD subjects by severity using a combination of cognitive and motor scoring. The researchers were successfully able to categorize PD through this combined analysis, and correlations between the subtype and disease severity were stable after follow-up.",The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms
862,"Can you provide specific examples of how artificial intelligence is being used in the research related to movement disorders, biofluids, and neuroimaging as biomarkers in Parkinson's disease?","We created multiple searches through the PubMed database (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) to determine the existing research on movement disorders and PD involving biofluids and neuroimaging as biomarkers and the use of artificial intelligence in movement disorders. Our first search, which resulted in�N�=�4613 English language articles pertaining to humans, aimed to provide context and background for the study. Few articles from our initial search focused on biofluids or neuroimaging as diagnostic, classification, or predictive biomarkers, which prompted subsequent searches. The second search (N�=�146) was limited to require artificial intelligence, machine learning, or deep learning, and the third search (N�=�39) was further limited to articles discussing neuroimaging. The search keywords for the three searches are described in�Table 1. Articles from the second and third searches were critically analyzed, and relevant articles were verified for scientific integrity by evaluating their place in subsequent literature and determining corroboration and support for claims. The inclusion criteria for eligible studies were as follows: 1) published in English; 2) used a sample of human subjects, including those who were clinically diagnosed with PD, atypical parkinsonism, or a movement disorder; and 3) investigated changes in neuroimaging, biofluids, or clinical symptoms with the aim of differentiating subjects with PD, atypical parkinsonisms, and/or a movement disorder from other subjects and HC. The articles from the second and third searches that passed these inclusion criteria were critically investigated and discussed in this study.",The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms
863,"Can you provide examples of specific diagnostic, prognostic, and susceptibility biomarkers in the context of mental health disorders?","A biomarker is a ?characteristic that is measured as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or biological responses to an exposure or intervention, including therapeutic interventions [6].? Types of biomarkers are determined by their utility. For instance, diagnostic biomarkers are used to assess the presence of a disease or identify a patient's subtype, while prognostic biomarkers can identify the likelihood of disease progression/recurrence and clinical events. By contrast, susceptibility biomarkers can determine the potential of a healthy patient to develop a disease [6,7]. Thus, it appears clear that multiple biomarkers may be necessary for a better characterization of the disease profile.",The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms
864,How have advancements in AI been utilized in the identification and diagnosis of Parkinson's disease?,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second-most common major neurodegenerative disorder, affecting about 2�% of adults globally (U.S.A.: ?1,000,000 people over 45 years of age; Canada: >100,000 people; China: ?22,000,000 people over 65 years of age) [1?3]. PD is the most frequent cause of parkinsonism, which is characterized by a combination of bradykinesia and other motor symptoms such as resting tremor and muscular rigidity. During the course of the disease, patients may manifest a decline in cognitive abilities [4]. It can also result in other non-motor symptoms such as depression and constipation [5]. As such, the identification of biomarker tools to diagnose and predict the progression and onset of PD is imperative.",The role of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms
865,Could you provide more insight into the specific risk factors and subtle aspects that emerged as relevant predictors of suicidal behaviors in the reviewed ML studies?,"The results that emerged from the reviewed studies lead to the conclusion that ML approaches attain greater accuracies in predicting suicidal behaviors across a variety of psychiatric disorders as compared to classical analysis methods. From the reviewed ML studies, well-known risk factors for suicide emerged as relevant predictors, along with new subtle aspects, such as physical and psychiatric comorbidities, presence of psychotic symptoms, and subclinical lab tests, that should be further analyzed and confirmed in future studies. However, additional work is needed to improve the predictive strength of ML algorithms, resolve the systemic lack of external validation, and finally make them become of use in clinical psychiatry. To do so, ML should integrate genetics, neurobiological, brain imaging, psychometric and clinical data to achieve better predictions. Then, algorithms should be presented in an intuitive way for both psychiatrists and patients to foster their adoption and easiness of use in the clinical setting. Although some attempts have been made, to date, ML approaches are not routinely part of clinical practice in psychiatry. We believe ML development should aim to gain the trust of clinicians, by proving to be valid, reliable, and understandable, to be realistically included in decision processes. Our review proved they can be valid in the context of suicide risk stratification; future studies should demonstrate that ML tools are reliable and, even more importantly, easy to understand by clinicians. Multifactorial disorders require multifaceted approaches, and ML could really help in this aspect; however, AI tools should not introduce further complexity in the decision processes, and therefore explainable AI will be a crucial point in further clinical development of predictive tools.",Machine learning and the prediction of suicide in psychiatric populations: a systematic review
866,"As a student interested in the intersection of AI and mental health, I would like to know more about the importance of reporting additional key metrics like PPV and F1-score in studies evaluating prediction models for mental health outcomes.","Finally, despite the high heterogeneity, most of the studies (>80%) obtained a good accuracy, namely 70% or higher. However, many studies did not report additional key metrics (e.g., PPV, F1-score) that are paramount to interpret the actual usefulness of prediction models. Moreover, only few studies tested their prediction on external validation samples; therefore, caution is needed when interpreting these findings, since it is possible that they suffer from overfitting.",Machine learning and the prediction of suicide in psychiatric populations: a systematic review
867,What specific types of psychiatric and physical comorbidities were found to be predictive in the models reviewed in the study?,"Moreover, features should be accurately selected, and their number should not be excessive (e.g., curse of dimensionality), as in some of the studies [44,�61]. Collecting such a huge amount of data could be feasible only in university centers, thus reducing the translational value of the results. This comprehensive review should also help in the choice of the right type and number of features. For example, pharmacological treatments, especially antipsychotics, were among the most important features in those studies who included them in the models. However, the pharmacological status of patients is often not reported (see Table�1), and in most cases type and dosage of different drugs are not included in the models. Based on the results of our review, it might be beneficial to include data related to pharmacological therapy in the models, since it could potentially enhance the predictive power and clinical applicability of these models. Moreover, the inclusion of pharmacological information might also help in defining protective features, not just risk factors, as suggested by studies showing that some stabilizers and antidepressants might actually reduce the risk of suicide [64]. Also, both psychiatric and physical comorbidities seem to have a predictive role in the presented models; especially, substance abuse as a comorbid disorder resulted to be highly predictive. This aspect suggests a comprehensive evaluation of the patient in order to define the clinical risk.",Machine learning and the prediction of suicide in psychiatric populations: a systematic review
868,How could increased uniformity in the assessment of suicidal behaviors and in the design of ML protocols improve predictions of suicide risk in clinical settings?,"A number of limitations should be highlighted. Methods varied widely across studies in terms of ML approach, sample selection, features employed, and preprocessing pipeline. Moreover, distinct investigations focused on a variety of different outcomes, from lifetime attempts to death by suicide, from cross-sectional to longitudinal evaluations. Such differences call for increased uniformity in the assessment of suicidal behaviors and in the design of ML protocols to enhance predictions of risk that may translate into clinical practice.",Machine learning and the prediction of suicide in psychiatric populations: a systematic review
869,"How do machine learning algorithms, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), demonstrate a greater predictive ability for suicide risk compared to traditional statistical methods and expert assessment of risk factors?","Although most of the significant features identified by ML are well-known risk factors for suicide [6,�7], ML demonstrate a greater predictive ability when compared with classical univariate statistics (i.e., logistic regression) and clinician assessment of risk factors [8,�9]. In particular, ML attained higher accuracies as compared to logistic regression [46,�49,�57,�61,�63,�67,�69,�87,�105]. These results suggest that advanced methods may inform the clinical decision-making processes in a more precise manner, likely overcoming the poor predictive value provided by classical statistics and expert assessment of the same risk factors [8,�9]. Interestingly, when present, CNN seemed to perform better than other ML algorithms, including SVM and RF. This might indicate the possibility of using deep learning to better stratify suicide risk, at the cost of a slight loss of interpretability.",Machine learning and the prediction of suicide in psychiatric populations: a systematic review
870,Can you explain in more detail how oversampling in the training phase works and how it helps to balance the sample in the context of machine learning analysis for predicting suicide risk in psychiatric disorders?,"Furthermore, another main issue regarding the reviewed studies is the imbalance between the prediction groups, given the low prevalence of the event of interest, with some studies including a larger control group, even tenfold bigger, than the suicidal group [41,�57,�77]. Although an imbalance is intrinsic to this kind of studies, given the prevalence of suicide in psychiatric disorders, some methods can be deployed to reduce the risk of false positive. Fan and colleagues [57] opted for an oversampling in the training phase, a procedure that creates new samples by connecting inliers and outliers from the original dataset. This technique allows the creation of dummy subjects to balance the sample, to foster the reliability of the ML analysis. Other analytical procedures to overcome the issue of imbalanced samples imply weighting of the hyperplane for uneven group sizes, selecting a specific ?weight? based on the difference between the groups.",Machine learning and the prediction of suicide in psychiatric populations: a systematic review
871,Can you provide more details on the specific scoring rankings used for ML studies in the review and how they were employed to evaluate the literature?,"The objective of our review was to summarize the results of ML studies in predicting suicidal behaviors in psychiatric clinical populations. Although the earliest publication in our review dates back to 1998, more than half of the reports were published between 2019 and 2022, ultimately suggesting that ML approaches in psychiatry, and especially in suicide prediction, are becoming more and more frequent nowadays. It is, therefore, important to constantly update the literature evaluation in order to keep pace with an exponentially increasing field. This translates into the opportunity to critically guide the nascent field and address key gaps in the existing literature. Compared to previous literature [95], our review focused only on psychiatric samples, in order to reduce the bias given by the diagnoses in general population. When focusing on broader samples, studies tend to find the presence of a psychiatric diagnosis as one of the most predictive features. Since it is well-known that the psychiatric population are at higher risk for suicidal behaviors, using general population often does not add knowledge in suicide prevention, while on the other side might mask more subtle risk factors. Moreover, compared to previous reviews in the field [95], we gave a more in-depth analysis of predictive features and also employed two different scoring ranking especially designed for ML studies (see Supplementary materials), in order to give the most precise overview of the literature. Critically, all these aspects might serve as a starting point for future studies.",Machine learning and the prediction of suicide in psychiatric populations: a systematic review
872,"How do clinical predictors such as co-occurring substance use, previous psychiatric hospitalizations, and male sex impact the risk of suicide in individuals with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)?","Regarding clinical predictors in MDD populations, Ilgen and colleagues [92] reported that co-occurring substance use, male sex, and previous psychiatric hospitalizations increased the risk of suicide. Similarly, in a more recent publication [89], hospitalization, previous suicide attempts, and co-diagnosis with a personality disorder resulted in the most relevant features to predict suicide, yielding an accuracy above 80%. Moreover, thyroxine plasma level and the severity of depression (measured via the Hamilton scale for depression - HAMD) were able to predict suicide with an accuracy of 70% [51].",Machine learning and the prediction of suicide in psychiatric populations: a systematic review
873,"Can you provide more information on the relationship between age and suicide risk, particularly why the risk tends to decrease in the elderly according to the study by Lopez-Castroman and colleagues?","Regarding demographic variables, sex, and age differences also emerged. Sex resulted in a significant predictor in five studies, showing either increased risk for males [39,�63,�92] or more complex relationships between biological sex and risk factors [29,�73]. Moreover, age ranked among the most predictive features in five studies [38,�39,�63,�71,�73,�94], with Lopez-Castroman and colleagues [71] also suggesting that the risk increases until middle-aged, but then tends to decrease in the elderly. Lastly, only two studies [72,�93] reported family history of suicide among the most relevant features assessed, whereas criminal or violent behavior were listed as predictive in two other investigations [28,�39].",Machine learning and the prediction of suicide in psychiatric populations: a systematic review
874,"How do psychopathological risk factors, social determinants of health, prior history of suicidal behaviors, and physical disorders contribute to the prediction of suicide risk in individuals?","Studies employing clinical and sociodemographic variables confirmed previous suicide risk factors. Previous suicide attempts, suicidal behaviors, or self-harm acts were among the strongest and most replicated predictors [28,�32,�33,�37?39,�61,�63,�71,�73,�75,�86?90]. Similarly, the type and severity of the psychiatric diagnosis seem to be associated with an increased risk of suicide. In detail, diagnosis and severity of MDD [4,�33,�56,�86,�88,�89,�91], psychotic features alone or accompanied by mood disorder [4,�63,�91], borderline personality disorder [33,�86,�89] and previous psychiatric hospitalizations [91,�92], ranked among the most relevant features. Moreover, also comorbidity with alcohol or substance use or abuse emerged as relevant features, irrespectively of the initial diagnosis [28,�57,�71?73,�90?93]. Interestingly, a significant effect on suicide prediction was reported for the use and dosage of psychiatric pharmacotherapy, specifically antipsychotics [33,�63,�64] and antidepressants, especially tricyclics [33,�64,�73]. Moreover, variable importance analysis in a sample of 390,000 US veterans showed that 51.1% of model performance was driven by psychopathological risk factors, 26.2% by social determinants of health, 14.8% by prior history of suicidal behaviors, and 6.6% by physical disorders [87].",Machine learning and the prediction of suicide in psychiatric populations: a systematic review
875,What were some of the specific metrics used in the studies that reported different metrics aside from accuracy or AUC in predicting mental health outcomes using AI techniques?,"A total of 62 studies (76.5%) reported at least the accuracy or the area under the curve (AUC) of their prediction, while the remaining studies reported different metrics (e.g., positive predictive value, sensitivity F1 score [84]), also because of the methods employed (e.g., clustering and neural networks [41,�68]).",Machine learning and the prediction of suicide in psychiatric populations: a systematic review
876,How have researchers utilized brain imaging data to predict suicide in the studies mentioned above?,"Ten studies employed brain imaging data to predict suicide: seven studies used resting-state MRI (rsMRI) [54,�55,�60,�68,�69,�79,�80], two used both rsMRI and structural MRI [58,�81], three used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) [49,�59,�82], and one structural MRI in combination with clinical and demographic data [53], and one single study employed measures from spectroscopy [47]. Eight studies (13.6%) analyzed the text obtained from interviews and EHR using natural language processing (NLP).",Machine learning and the prediction of suicide in psychiatric populations: a systematic review
877,Can you provide more information on how the number of features employed in predicting suicidal behaviors varied across studies and what impact this variability may have on the accuracy of the predictions?,"The number of features employed in the prediction of suicidal behaviors varied considerably across studies, ranging from 10 [71] to 190,919 [64]. Specifically, 20 studies (24.7%) predicted suicide with less than 50 features, seven studies (8.6%) employed between 50 and 100 features, 11 (13.6%) between 100 and 200, ten (12.3%) between 200 and 500, and, lastly, 11 studies (13.6%) employed more than 500 features.

878,How were mood disorders specifically categorized in the studies that included them as part of their findings?,"Among reports detailing patients? diagnosis, mood disorders were prevalent in 64 studies (79%). Specifically, major depressive disorder (MDD) was studied in 37 investigations, and bipolar disorder (BD) in 21 publications. Six studies simply reported ?mood disorders? to characterize the sample. Patients affected by schizophrenia were included in 14 studies, whereas four enrolled patients diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and five simply reported ?psychosis? as a sample description. Thirteen studies focused on anxiety disorders, eight on substance-use disorders and four on obsessive-compulsive disorders.",Machine learning and the prediction of suicide in psychiatric populations: a systematic review
879,Can you explain why the imbalance in sample sizes between the suicidal and non-suicidal groups in the studies mentioned is important to consider when developing predictive algorithms for suicide risk assessment?,"Given the relatively low prevalence of the event of interest (i.e., suicide), most of the samples were unbalanced in terms of the number of subjects in each group. For instance, in the studies conducted by Fan and colleagues [57] and Wang and colleagues [77], the difference in size between the suicidal group and the non-suicidal control group was tenfold (i.e., 205 subjects in the ?suicide? group and 2963 in the ?no suicide? group). Similarly, the difference in Xu et al. [41] was 20-fold, with 2323 patients reporting self-harm and 46,460 patients with no self-harm characteristics. It is important to note that, on the one hand, very large differences in sample size require significant corrections in the predictive algorithm (e.g., the weighting of the hyperplane for uneven group sizes), whereas, on the other hand, they reflect real data, as the prevalence of suicidal events in the assessed population is typically low.",Machine learning and the prediction of suicide in psychiatric populations: a systematic review

896,How do traditional suicide risk factors compare to psychiatric biomarkers in terms of predicting suicidal behaviors?,"Alarmingly, recent studies suggest that the detection of risk factors and the implementation of interventions are inadequate [3]. The majority of individuals who have attempted suicide are reported to consult with physicians prior to the attempt, suggesting that a possibility to intervene might be possible in these help-seeking subjects. The difficulty in predicting suicidal behaviors relies on the lack of clear psychiatric biomarkers and the poor predictive power of individual risk factors [4]. Suicidal behaviors, as many other psychiatric phenomena, are likely the result of the complex relationship between several environmental and trait variables interacting to modify the actual risk rate [4,�5]. Well-recognized risk factors for suicide encompass mental disorders, previous suicide attempts, early trauma, negative life events, and vulnerable periods, with important differences among sexes in terms of ideation and lethality [6,�7]. However, traditional suicide risk factors have only limited clinical predictive value and show a relatively poor clinical utility in predicting suicide occurrence [8,�9], even in high-risk population, such as depressed patients [10].",Machine learning and the prediction of suicide in psychiatric populations: a systematic review
897,"Can you provide more details on the specific ML algorithms that were used in the studies included in the systematic review, and how they compared in terms of accuracy for predicting suicidal behaviors in psychiatric populations?","Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising tool to enhance suicidal prediction. However, as many large-sample studies mixed psychiatric and non-psychiatric populations, a formal psychiatric diagnosis emerged as a strong predictor of suicidal risk, overshadowing more subtle risk factors specific to distinct populations. To overcome this limitation, we conducted a systematic review of ML studies evaluating suicidal behaviors exclusively in psychiatric clinical populations. A systematic literature search was performed from inception through November 17, 2022 on PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus following the PRISMA guidelines. Original research using ML techniques to assess the risk of suicide or predict suicide attempts in the psychiatric population were included. An assessment for bias risk was performed using the transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis (TRIPOD) guidelines. About 1032 studies were retrieved, and 81 satisfied the inclusion criteria and were included for qualitative synthesis. Clinical and demographic features were the most frequently employed and random forest, support vector machine, and convolutional neural network performed better in terms of accuracy than other algorithms when directly compared. Despite heterogeneity in procedures, most studies reported an accuracy of 70% or greater based on features such as previous attempts, severity of the disorder, and pharmacological treatments. Although the evidence reported is promising, ML algorithms for suicidal prediction still present limitations, including the lack of neurobiological and imaging data and the lack of external validation samples. Overcoming these issues may lead to the development of models to adopt in clinical practice. Further research is warranted to boost a field that holds the potential to critically impact suicide mortality.",Machine learning and the prediction of suicide in psychiatric populations: a systematic review

917,How do fermented foods specifically impact the microbiota-gut-brain axis and contribute to mental health benefits?,"Fermented foods can have a considerable impact on health by virtue of the variety of different microbial strains, metabolites and other bioactives that can be present therein. These components can be optimised to offer maximal neural and mental health benefits to the individual. This in-depth review has highlighted the individual components of the microbiota-gut-brain axis that, on the basis of clinical and pre-clinical studies, can be modulated by fermented foods and/or components thereof. While noting the increasing body of research that has been generated in recent years, it also reveals the critical need for additional human studies with unfermented controls to truly identify beneficial impacts that act on the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Understanding the factors that mould the fermented food microbiome and microbial metabolites will help to reveal the impact these factors can have on the biological benefit conferred by the fermented food. Finally, although there are many obstacles and considerations that need to be accounted for, fermented foods form a vital part of the next generation of microbiota-based therapeutics targeting mental health.

918,"How can advancements such as plant metabarcoding be utilized to identify biomarkers associated with fermented food consumption in a clinical setting, and how can these biomarkers be used to optimize fermented food intake for mental health benefits?","Biomarkers: Identification and measurement of biomarkers exclusively associated with intake of a specific fermented food can be of tremendous importance as it can accurately measure fermented food consumption in a clinical atmosphere. It is a much more accurate measure compared to dietary questionnaire counterparts that are used to register food intake. Biomarkers can be of critical clinical relevance, especially when diverse fermented foods are being consumed. However, since fermented foods and other food products might share the same core substrate profile, they might result in overlapping biomarker profiles. This requires the need for identifying biomarkers that can be accurately associated with the consumption of the fermented food. Advancements such as plant metabarcoding offers a unique solution, wherein genomic sequences from human digest and faecal samples act as unique fingerprints in identifying food consumed especially when multiple food are part of the regimen (Petrone et al., 2023). A recent systematic analysis has revealed certain biomarkers that show a high degree of fidelity towards fermented foods such as wine, beer,�sourdough bread, cheese and tea (Li et al., 2021a). Biomarkers can then be used as a proxy to titrate the frequency of consumption of a given intervention in participants thus becoming a part of the next generation of tools employed for precise dietary assessment. The study by Li et al. also revealed biomarkers for�fermented vegetables, fish, fruit and meas consumption were less explored, and as a result a dearth of information on microbial metabolites as well as other host derived metabolites related to these substrate categories (Li et al., 2021a). Follow up studies have furthered the use of biomarkers to titre for food consumption of a given substrate category and also their potential correlation to cardiometabolic health (Li et al., 2023).

This is of particular importance as the beneficial effect conferred may not always be a result of the fermentation process. Ultimately, studies assessing the effects of fermented foods require the inclusion of suitable unfermented controls. This is also highlighted in the�Table 2,�Table 3�(preclinical) and�Table 4,�Table 5�(clinical), which focus on the delineation of cohorts to account for the effect of unfermented controls.

920,"How do next-generation ""omics"" techniques contribute to the standardization of microbial communities in fermented foods?","The highly malleable microbial community present in fermented foods is difficult to standardise and poses a critical challenge (Mukherjee et al., 2022). Although the�Codex Alimentarius�aids in providing guidelines and standards, with a considerable focus on fermented dairy products (Alimentarius, 2003), other fermented food categories have not been extensively explored. However, such consensus or regulatory guidelines require an element of cultural sensitivity that is considerate of the origin and traditional practices involved in fermented food production (Campbell et al., 2022). The increased application of next generation ?omics? techniques has aided the process of standardisation by identification of various community members and their complex relationships. This has led to the development of extensive data archives (Zinno et al., 2022,�Whon et al., 2021,�Chaudhary et al., 2021). These repositories are valuable sources of information and can be used as reference sources to obtain a preliminary hypothesis on the type of microbial community or bioactive molecule(s) that could be present in the fermented food, which could be harvested for therapeutic benefit.

921,How do traditionally prepared fermented foods compare to commercially produced fermented foods in terms of their impact on the microbiota-gut-brain-axis and mental health outcomes?,"The production of fermented foods is influenced by various environmental conditions and processing parameters. Indeed, the analysis of a large collection of�fermented milk�samples, predominantly yogurt, koumiss, cheese and fermented yak milk from Mongolia, China and Russia, shows a distinct clustering based on geographical origin (Zhong et al., 2016). The presence of a region-specific microbiota was also observed in Mongolian fermented cow milk samples from Chita and Kalmykia in Russia (Liu et al., 2015) and Airag samples from Mongolia (Choi, 2016). The�genetic polymorphisms�of starter cultures containing�Saccharomyces cerevisiae�obtained from Manipur (Indo-Burma) and Sikkim (Himalayan) also varied in a manner that reflected geographical origins (Jeyaram et al., 2011). Scale of production and manufacturing conditions could partially explain the variation in fermented food microbiome as a consequence of geographical location, as was the case with�fermented meat products�obtained from France, Italy and Spain compared to products obtained from Belgium and Germany. The fermented meat product showed distinct�LAB�communities segregated by geographical zone of production and the use of different starter cultures (Van Reckem et al., 2019). This was mirrored in other fermented foods, such as Kochujang (Nam et al., 2012,�Bal et al., 2017) and also on�LAB�fermented pickles from China, wherein foods made through commercial fermentation contained more LAB than those generated through artisanal fermentation (An et al., 2021). Emerging research suggests the presence of a distinct core�mycobiota, as seen with Chinese traditional dough starters, fermented�rice wine�and Chinese grape wine (Huang et al., 2021,�Bartram et al., 1994,�Liu et al., 2020d) and even the viral community being more indicative of geographical location in�kimchi�samples (Jung et al., 2018). However, this does not hold true across all studies of fermented foods. Indeed, a large study of sourdough starter cultures (n?=?500) revealed homogeneity and only weak influence of geography on shaping the fermented food microbiome (Landis et al., 2021). Nonetheless, geographical location and scale of production are of critical importance as artisanal/traditionally fermented foods may possess a different microbial community that is critical for the production of bioactive metabolites, which may be absent from commercially produced strains. An example of this is observed in milk�kefir, wherein traditionally fermented�kefir�shows the potential to lower cholesterol in metabolic models of obesity in mice. Consequently, the same effects were not observed in specific commercial kefir beverages (Bourrie et al., 2018). The taxonomic composition driving variation in biological effect is also observed in kombucha samples sourced from artisanal and commercial sources (Villarreal-Soto et al., 2020). In fact, these subtle variations in taxonomic compositions between commercial and traditionally prepared fermented foods have recently been revealed to elicit different circulatory cytokines profile in a randomised crossover trial in humans in that, traditionally prepared kefir showed a greater reduction in CRP, sVCAM, IL-18 and TNF-� compared to commercial kefir (Bourrie et al., 2023). It is important to consider such factors when implementing fermented food based interventions targeting microbiota-gut-brain-axis modulation.",Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health
922,Can you provide more detail on the different outcomes observed in studies evaluating the effects of fermented dairy intervention on cognitive function and inflammatory markers in humans?,"Fermented dairy intervention in humans have yielded mixed results, ranging from an absence of differences between the intervention and placebo groups in mini-mental status exam (MMSE) scores (Beauchet et al., 2019,�Suzuki et al., 2019) to a mixed trend with respect to circulating BDNF (Chung et al., 2014,�Suzuki et al., 2019,�Nev� et al., 2021) and�CRP�(Chen et al., 2019,�Kuroda et al., 2007,�Gonz�lez et al., 2019) levels. Similarly, when a fermented food enriched diet is considered, especially while employing multiple fermented foods of varied substrate categories, an increased gut microbiota diversity was observed (Wastyk et al., 2021), a feature that was not observed in a 4 week fermented food based dietary intervention study when compared to the arm receiving control diet (Berding et al., 2023). A potential explanation for this could be the variation in fermented foods categories employed in both studies along with duration of the dietary intervention.",Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health
923,How do fermented foods influence the immune system and gut microbiota in relation to the microbiota-gut-brain axis and mental health?,"The ability of fermented foods to influence the major communication pathways involved in gut to brain signalling has been foundational in its adoption to target mental health. To identify fermented foods that modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis, it is important to know the current ways by which fermented foods are able to alter communication pathways that are involved in relaying information from the gut to the brain. The priming of the�immune system�and the restructuring of the gut microbiota and microbial metabolites via fermented food supplementation has been extensively studied. In addition to the immune system, the�ENS, along with its gastric peptides and hormones, is also being shaped by fermented food supplementation.�Table 3�provides a summary of the current understanding of fermented foods on communication pathways between the gut and brain derived from�Section 2.",Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health
924,How do fermented foods specifically influence the microbiota-gut-brain axis communication and cognitive health?,"Several literature works have documented the capacity of fermented foods to restructure the gut environment and modulate host health (Stiemsma et al., 2020,�Leeuwendaal et al., 2022,�Selhub et al., 2014,�Melini et al., 2019,�Aslam et al., 2020,�Costa et al., 2021,�Moreno-Arribas et al., 2020), hinting at the potential capacity of fermented foods to influence microbiota gut-brain-axis communication. Some of the modulatory components are produced as a result of the fermentation process. For instance, fermented beverages can contain a percentage of alcohol and other volatile components that can influence the composition of the gut microbiota. The impact of the alcoholic fraction of fermented food on the gut microbiome has been reported in murine (Lee et al., 2020) and human studies (Marques et al., 2022). The alcoholic portion of the fermented food has to be accounted for as it has been recently implicated for its ability to confer a neurological benefit to the food consumer. A retrospective�cohort study�analysing the impact of alcohol consumption and changes in their intake frequency with risk of dementia revealed its potential neuroprotective activity. The study reported mild and moderate drinkers had a lower risk of all-cause dementia compared to non-drinkers whereas heavy drinkers were posed to have a higher risk of all cause dementia (Jeon et al., 2023). In fact, recent�systematic reviews�have revealed that low to moderate percentage intake of alcohol in several of the fermented foods and beverages have been linked with lowered risk of Alzheimer?s disease and dementia (Porras-Garc�a et al., 2023). For this reason, it is also important to control for the effect of alcohol on the gut microbiota and gut brain communicatory pathways. Fermented foods can also alter metabolite production in the gut even without altering the microbial composition or diversity in some circumstances. This can be due to the presence of dietary fibres and bioactive components that are intrinsically present in the food (Zhou et al., 2019,�Wang et al., 2021). Fermented foods can also be rich in phytochemicals and other bioactive agents, though some of these originate from the food substrate and hence are also present at similar concentrations in the unfermented counterparts. In light of this, it is important to include unfermented controls in preclinical and human study design, so as to accurately understand the components of fermented foods driving the change on the intestinal milieu and on cognitive health.�Supplementary table 1�provides a non-exhaustive compilation of important phytochemicals present in both fermented and unfermented foods that can influence microbiota-gut-brain communication. Fermented foods also contain a variety of potentially health-promoting microorganisms that can confer better gut health in addition to contributing towards the restructuring of the gut microbiota. Indeed, strains isolated from fermented camels? milk, pickled�Chinese cabbage�(LAB fermented), fermented yogurt when formulated into a probiotic cocktail (Lactobacillus�species) all showed the ability to restore the colonic microbial community in antibiotic-treated mice and shift the gut microbiota at a phyla level from a Pseudomonadota-dominated environment to a profile similar to the control group (Shi et al., 2018).",Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health
925,Can you provide more information on how fermented dairy products impact intestinal permeability and the peripheral cytokine profile in preclinical studies?,"In addition to the modulation of the gut microbiota, preclinical studies have also looked at the impact of fermented dairy products on intestinal permeability (Putt et al., 2017), microbial metabolites (Gao et al., 2021) and peripheral cytokine profile (Du et al., 2022). Frequently studied microbial metabolites, SCFA?s were elevated in interventions containing fermented plant-based products such as fermented carrot juice (Liu et al., 2021,�Yu et al., 2022,�Ma et al., 2021),�fermented beverages�containing fruits and vegetables (Wang et al., 2019), and fermented raspberry�pomace�enriched with�lactic acid bacteria�(Wu et al., 2021). SCFA?s are implicated in the maintenance of intestinal barrier integrity (O'riordan et al., 2022) and might be the driving force in increasing the expression of tight junction proteins thereby reinforcing the permeability of the intestine (Zorraqu�n-Pe�a et al., 2021,�Taladrid et al., 2021).",Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health
926,How do somatostatin and SCFAs potentially influence feeding behavior and satiety in relation to gut microbiota modulation?,"Another gut hormone associated with satiety is somatostatin, which has long been implicated in satiety and hunger. Activation of somatostatin positive neurons in the brain shows increased preference towards high-calorie foods and may be implicated in the development of metabolic conditions such as obesity (Kumar and Singh, 2020); but it is important to note that somatostatin has alsobeen shown to regulate the release of gastric enzymes, increased�gastric emptying�and mediating inflammatory response. The stomatostatin release profile after consumption of fermented�soy�bean (natto) was demonstrated in mice subjected to gastric mucosal injury. The mice receiving the fermented soy bean showed higher levels of somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and motilin (Suo et al., 2015) and concurrently showed lowered levels of serum cytokines. Microbial metabolites are also being studied for their participation in modulating satiety of the host. Several studies exploring the effects of SCFAs have shown that feeding behaviour can also be influenced by these bi-products of bacterial fermentation (Brooks et al., 2017). For example, yogurt supplementation to rats reduced weight and elevated faecal SCFAs (Qu et al., 2018). Similarly, a type 2 diabetes model of mice receiving�kombucha�lowered fasting blood glucose and increased faecal SCFAs compared to unfermented tea (Xu et al., 2022). However, both interventions maintained intestinal permeability and restructured the gut microbiome by increasing the abundance of�Lactobacillus, Butyricicococcus�and�Lachnospiraceae�with a concurrent increase in the levels of GLP-1 and PYY secretion. A potential mechanistic explanation for this could be the stimulating action of SCFA on the mRNA for POMC, AgRP, CART in the hypothalamus (regions of the brain implicated in feeding and energy expenditure) (Pichiah et al., 2016), a pattern which is in agreement with targeted peripheral administration of acetate (Frost et al., 2014). Together, these studies hint at a potential crosstalk between gut microbiota, microbial metabolite profiles and the ENS/CNS within the individual. Most of the discussed pre-clinical studies have included only a single time point post-intervention with the fermented food. The analysed parameters include only a subset of the phenotypical traits such as�body weight, feeding pattern and�adiposity. In addition to this, molecular markers implicated in understanding satiety and feeding behaviour is also being incorporated. This method of experimental design might be insensitive in capturing transient changes in the gut microbiota and microbial metabolite composition, and gut hormone profile, and can therefore be resolved by sampling at multiple time points.",Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health
927,"How do ghrelin and leptin levels in circulation relate to food reward-motivated behavior, and how do fermented foods potentially impact these hormone levels?","Desacyl ghrelin and acyl ghrelin are�orexigenic�hormones that are the predominant forms of circulating ghrelin and are implicated in the regulation of appetite and its�neuroprotective effects�(Lach et al., 2018,�Rhea et al., 2018,�Huang et al., 2019). Unlike serotonin, ghrelin is released in the periphery and can cross the BBB, thereby binding to several targets associated with food reward including corticolimbic,�amygdala, insula and orbitofrontal cortex (Zanchi et al., 2017,�Farokhnia et al., 2019). Leptin, an anorexigenic hormone produced by adipocytes and�enterocytes, is shown to activate several regions of the brain such as the�brain stem, parahippocampal gyrus, middle frontal gyri, middle temporal gyrus, right�hypothalamus�and lingual gyrus (Zanchi et al., 2017). Several detailed reviews have highlighted the role of gut hormones in regulating food reward-motivated behaviour in the host and also in contributing towards the conversation between the gut and the brain (Lach et al., 2018,�Zanchi et al., 2017,�Decarie-Spain and Kanoski, 2021). It is therefore essential to also understand if fermented foods can alter levels of ghrelin/leptin in circulation and consequently affect the food reward-motivated behaviour of the host.",Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health
928,"How do bioactive components in fermented foods influence the secretion of incretins such as GLP-1, and how does this impact satiety?","Both unfermented and fermented foods contain bioactive components that can influence the secretion of�incretins�such as GLP ??1, a gut hormone implicated in satiety (Johnson and De Mejia, 2016). It is therefore necessary for studies focusing on the impact of fermented foods on the enteric environment to concurrently account for the effect of unfermented controls on EEC secretion profiles. The patterns of endogenous and exogenous release of GLP-1 have been well reported in murine models and human studies (Flint et al., 1998,�Terrill et al., 2019,�Chen et al., 2021a) and therefore can be adopted to study the effects of fermented foods on satiation. Interestingly, in-vitro studies on kippuku-cha, a fermented Japanese beverage, was found to activate GPR-120 and stimulate the release of GLP-1 via phosphorylation of the Erk1/2�(p42/44�MAP�kinase) pathway (Nagasawa et al., 2020). Similarly, phenol and�polysaccharide�extracts from�quinoa�yogurt fermented with�starter cultures�of�S. thermophilus�and�Lactobacillus bulgaricus�stimulated the release of GLP-1 and influenced expression of�proglucagon�mRNA, CCK and c-FOS along with DDP-1?V inhibitory potential (Obaroakpo et al., 2020). The study revealed that the fermented product elevated concentrations of GLP-1 and proglucagon than the unfermented controls. Such studies assessing the incretin release profile using in-vitro studies must be interpreted with caution, as their effects can be inflated when compared to in-vivo conditions. For example, fermented dairy-based products such as whey possess the ability to stimulate the release of GLP-1 and CCK (Chaudhari et al., 2017,�S�nchez-Moya et al., 2020), however these effects were not translated to in-vivo studies (Kondrashina et al., 2018). The study stated that this lack of translatability between in-vitro to in-vivo models could be due to the action of gastrointestinal enzymes, which may reduce the GLP secretogogue capacity of�fermented dairy products�unless enterically protected (Kondrashina et al., 2018).",Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health
929,How do the gut hormones and peptides of the enteroendocrine system interact with the microbiota-gut-brain axis to regulate motility and appetite?,"The enteroendocrine system (EES) is capable of secreting molecules that can influence the afferent vagus nerve, and receptors of these molecules are expressed higher up in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and hypothalamic regions of the brain. These regions undermine energy expenditure, food preferences and satiety of the host thereby mediating feeding behaviour (Latorre et al., 2016,�Holst, 2013). Functioning of the EES is also influenced by microbial metabolites that are introduced through dietary intake. The EES primarily hosts a network of�gut hormones�such as serotonin, neuropeptide-Y, GLP-1,�ghrelin,�peptide YY�(PYY), motilin and�somatostatin�that continuously relay information to the enteric nervous system (ENS). The impact of each of these gut hormones and peptides on the microbiota-gut-brain axis has been described in detail across multiple extensive reviews (Richards et al., 2021,�Wachsmuth et al., 2022,�Sun et al., 2020). In brief, the hormones of the EES regulate motility, appetite, release of insulin and bile acids (Sun et al., 2020). The submucosal and the myentric plexsus of the ENS communicate with each other via a small collection of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, which can be secreted and modulated by the fermented food microbiome, microbial metabolites and co-occurring active principles.",Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health
930,"Can you elaborate on the specific mechanisms through which fermented foods, such as milk kefir, fermented Chinese medication, and tempeh, are able to modulate serotonin levels in the gut, as discussed in the preclinical studies mentioned?","Preclinical studies report lowered serotonin turnover in the colon of mice supplemented with milk kefir compared to unfermented controls (Van De Wouw et al., 2020), which was also reflected in mice subjected to immobilisation stress and supplemented with fermented Chinese medication such as fermented�Mentha arvensis�and fermented�Cornus officinalis�(Tian et al., 2018,�Tian et al., 2020). Other preclinical models have demonstrated the ability of fermented soy-based food such as�tempeh�to modulate the level of serotonergic genes. Tempeh-fed zebrafish showed upregulation in genes involved in transportation, synthesis and signalling of serotonin, namely�tph1b, tph2�and�slc6a4a�genes in the brain (Chen et al., 2021b). The ability of fermented foods to modulate peripheral serotonin levels could be attributed to the presence of endogenous bacteria within the food, which are capable of producing these metabolites as a result of the fermentation process (Jeong et al., 2021,�Gallardo-Fern�ndez et al., 2022,�Kumar et al., 2022). The ability of fermented foods to modulate gut health could also be credited to�synbiotic�components present in the food. A study of a murine model of constipation employed a synbiotic yogurt containing�konjac mannan�oligosaccharide�(prebiotic) and�Bifidobacterium animalis�spp lactis�(probiotic). The study reported an increase in levels of acetylcholine,�substance P�and upregulation of�motilin,�vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor�(VIPR-4) and 5-HT4 receptors in colonic tissue upon intervention with the synbiotic containing yogurt (Li et al., 2021b).",Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health
931,How do different types of fermented foods impact cortisol levels in response to stress in human cohorts?,"Fermented food�interventions in human cohorts have been limited and conflicting. An 8-week intervention of fermented porcine placenta resulted in lower serum cortisol levels along with concurrent reduction in the mRNA expression of IL-1? following treadmill stress testing (Yoon et al., 2020). Similarly, reductions in salivary cortisol was observed in students receiving�Lacticaseibacillus casei strain Shirota�and subjected to examination stress. The same strain was also shown to blunt the release of corticosterone in rats subjected to water avoidance stress (Takada et al., 2016). Conversely, some studies reported no effects of fermented foods on post-stress cortisol levels (Jaatinen et al., 2014,�Marcos et al., 2004), potentially due to the small quantity, diverse nature of fermented food being consumed, and short duration of intervention.",Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health
932,How does dysregulation of the HPA axis and its interplay with the immune system impact neuropsychiatric disorders?,"The HPA axis is a key regulator of mood and behaviour and forms the neurohormonal component of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Dysregulation of the HPA axis and its interplay with the immunological system is implicated in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders (Wingenfeld and Wolf, 2011,�Rinne et al., 2002,�Cruz-Pereira et al., 2020). Cortisol, the main stress hormone of the HPA axis, has been shown to modulate the immune system (Bellavance and Rivest, 2014), BBB permeability (Varanoske et al., 2022) and intestinal barrier integrity (Zhao et al., 2019,�Karl et al., 2017). The latter is responsible for sustaining�homoeostasis�in the gut micro-environment (Amini-Khoei et al., 2019,�Uren Webster et al., 2020) and can be influenced by the neurological state of the host.",Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health
933,"Could you provide more details on how fermented foods affect the hippocampal and cortical regions of the brain in terms of mRNA expression related to inflammation markers like IL-6, TNF-�, TLR4 receptor, and MCP1 protein?","Studies are increasingly shifting towards understanding the far-reaching effects of fermented foods on neuroinflammation. A spatial observation of the immunomodulatory effects of fermented foods on the brain revealed that hippocampal and cortical regions of the brain exhibit lower levels of mRNA expression pertaining to IL-6, TNF-�, TLR4 receptor and MCP1 protein, which was significantly upregulated in mice fed a high-fat diet (Kim et al., 2022b). This was also observed in the hypothalamic regions of the brain and serum in mice subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress when supplemented with fermented rice germ (Batsukh et al., 2022). Future work is needed to explore the impact of fermented foods at each compartment of the microbiota-gut-brain-immune axis, particularly the effects of microbial metabolites on the intestinal barrier, peripheral immune system, BBB and central immune system. This information would provide valuable insight into understanding the molecular underpinnings of the microbiota-gut-brain-immune axis.",Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health
934,How do fermented food products impact intestinal integrity in the context of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)?,"Several studies have examined the impact of fermented food products on intestinal integrity in the context of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).�Murine models�of IBD when supplemented with�Bacillus subtilis�fermented milk�showed rescue in intestinal morphology as well as elevation in tight junction protein level as opposed to the disease control (Zhang et al., 2021b). This restoration of intestinal tight junction proteins has also been observed using in-vitro and murine models of IBD supplemented with fermented barley and soybean (Woo et al., 2016c). Studies have also measured rescue of intestinal integrity via measurement of bacterial translocation. As the microbial community resides within the gut, translocation can indicate a compromise to intestinal integrity. The translocation of microbes and their cellular components can activate the peripheral immune system resulting in the release of cytokines that can ultimately trigger altered BBB integrity and neuroinflammation (Maes et al., 2013,�Vujkovic-Cvijin et al., 2022). Indeed, pre-treatment of�mice�with milk fermented using�Lacticaseibacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei�lowered intestinal permeability as visualised by the reduced translocation of�Salmonella typhimurium�(Acurcio et al., 2020). Although less frequently studied, downstream reinforcing effects of fermented food on BBB integrity was observed following�kimchi�and�kefir�supplementation, which increased expression of BBB tight junction proteins along with a sex-specific reduction of mRNA levels of IL-1? and TNF� in the pre-frontal cortex and�hippocampus�in murine models (Kim et al., 2022b,�Murray et al., 2019).",Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health
935,"How do fermented foods, such as sauerkraut and yogurt, impact the immune system and potentially contribute to host immunoregulation through activation of the hydrocarboxylic acid receptor (HCA3R)?","A potential mechanism by which fermented foods are able to exert immunomodulatory effects is through activation of the hydrocarboxylic acid receptor (HCA3R), as a consequence of consuming�lactic acid bacteria�(LAB) fermented food.�Sauerkraut, also rich in LAB upon consumption is shown to elicit a chemotactic response from�monocytes�via D-Phenylacetic acid, a potent HCA3R receptor agonist (Peters et al., 2019). Large scale genome wide association analysis have revealed the LAB found in human gut likely to be from foods (Pasolli et al., 2020). Interestingly, a human�observational study�on the TwinsUK cohort showed elevation in�B. animalis subsp. lactis�with yogurt consumers that positively correlated with 3-hydroxyoctanoate levels, which is an agonist for HCA3 and could be potentially implicated in host immunoregulation (Le Roy et al., 2022). Further studies on the hydrocarboxilic receptor revealed only humans and great apes to possess three hydrocarboxylic receptors, as opposed to the two (HCA1R, HCA2R) seen in other organisms, indicating the development of evolutionary adaptations to accommodate the consumption of fermented foods (Peters et al., 2019).",Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health
936,How do microbial metabolites regulate the immune system and impact the brain and behavior of the host?,"Microbial metabolites are capable of regulating the immune system (Lavelle and Sokol, 2020) via systemic circulation (Colombo et al., 2021) or by the�vagus nerve�(Bluthe et al., 1996,�Namgung et al., 2022,�Huffman et al., 2019). Growing evidence on the presence of receptors for bacterial�cell wall components�and�immunostimulants�such as�peptidoglycan�and�lipopolysaccharides�in the brain depict the far reaching ability of the gut microbiota on the brain and behaviour of the host (Wheeler et al., 2023,�Arentsen et al., 2017,�Tillinger and Mravec, 2021). This microbiota-gut-immune-brain connection is influenced by different dietary and lifestyle choices across lifespan (Bostick et al., 2022,�Ratsika et al., 2023).

938,"How do fermented foods contribute to modulating the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota and their metabolites, ultimately impacting mental health through the gut-brain axis?","Food fermentation�was traditionally employed to enable longer storage/shelf-life of food substrates that would otherwise spoil quickly, which was crucial in times of scarcity (Amato et al., 2021,�Borremans et al., 2020,�Ross et al., 2002), whilst concurrently enhancing flavour profile (Liu et al., 2019b,�Cai et al., 2019,�Mandha et al., 2022,�Peraza and Perron, 2022), reducing the toxicity of raw materials/controlling pathogenic microorganisms and simultaneously allowing for their digestion (Reddy and Pierson, 1994,�Maixner et al., 2021). Fermented foods are mainly classified into categories based on the substrate used, e.g., cereal, dairy, meat, fish, vegetable and legume (Tamang et al., 2020), which differ with respect to their primary food substrate and type of fermentation (e.g., defined�starter culture, spontaneous or back-slopped culture).�Table 1�in this review highlights the diverse nature of fermented foods that is referred to in this review along with the substrate category and the nature of fermentation employed in its production. The microbial community present in a fermented food is associated with a number of factors, including the type of substrate (Achi and Asamudo, 2019,�Leech et al., 2020), geographical location (Van Reckem et al., 2019,�Jung et al., 2018,�Zhong et al., 2016,�Li et al., 2017), pH (Yang et al., 2020) and method of preparation (Lee et al., 2021,�Van Reckem et al., 2019) (See�Fig. 1). Fermented foods are a rich source of�beneficial microorganisms�(potential probiotics) (Okada et al., 2018,�Wang et al., 2022) as well as�bioactive peptides�(Chaudhary et al., 2021),�phytochemicals�and vitamins (Septembre-Malaterre et al., 2018,�Shahbazi et al., 2021b). As researchers increasingly investigate the impact of different dietary intervention strategies and habitual dietary practices on sculpting the gut microbiota (Losasso et al., 2018,�Tanes et al., 2021,�Stege et al., 2022) and, consequently, their metabolites (Wu et al., 2016,�Chen et al., 2022), it is not surprising that fermented foods receive particular attention. This is in no small way related to their capacity to modulate the composition and/or diversity of the gut microbiota (Bellikci-Koyu et al., 2019,�Le Roy et al., 2022,�Wastyk et al., 2021) and/or the production of microbial metabolites, such as�short chain fatty acids�(SCFA), polyphenolic (Johnson et al., 2019,�Zorraqu�n-Pe�a et al., 2021),�tryptophan�and bile metabolites (Scott et al., 2020) and, as a result, can modulate the pathways that relay information from gut to the brain.�Table 2�provides a primer on the nomenclature of various microbial components and bioactive components along with consensus statement that aptly captures their function.

They found that the expression of ?disgust? prominently helped to distinguish patients with depression, highlighting the utility of linguistic analysis for capturing emotional markers in mental health diagnostics.�Chen et�al.�presented a decision support tool for ADHD diagnosis, integrating ML with clinical knowledge and processing not only related symptoms, but also comorbid conditions. Their approach pointed to specific features in the Diagnostic Interview for ADHD in Adults that help distinguish ADHD from other conditions, and crucially, their model also identified and flagged complex ADHD cases for expert review. Finally,�Merhbene et�al.�conducted a systematic review on ML for eating disorder detection, revealing challenges such as insufficient data quantity and quality, alongside a lack of representation of minority groups, reduced clinical involvement in development, and culturally driven heterogeneities. Overall, the number and heterogeneity of symptom presentations makes clinical diagnoses a highly complex task in mental healthcare (5), and these papers highlight how ML might be of value to professionals in this regard.","Editorial: Mental health, epidemiology and machine learning"

947,"How does the use of interpretable machine learning, such as SHAP, contribute to boosting clinicians' confidence in using predictive models for the assessment of PNI status?","Radiomics? capacity to characterize tumour size and heterogeneity may explain why the radiomics model outperformed the clinical model (DeLong?s test, all�P<0.05). However, the radiomics model was comparable to the radiological model (DeLong?s test,�P=0.196?0.981), and the main reason for this result may be that the CT feature-tumour location emerged as an important independent predictive factor in this study, which was not reflected by radiomics. This finding emphasizes the complementary nature of radiological features and radiomics, highlighting the importance of constructing a combined model for a comprehensive assessment of PNI status. Our results show that the combined model is better than a single model. We constructed four machine-learning models based on radscore and clinicoradiological features, and the results showed that the XGBoost model was more accurate and robust. The satisfactory results of the prospective validation cohort further demonstrated the applicability and reliability of the model. We further explored the prognostic information of the combined model, and preliminary results of this study indicate that the combined model of PNI can predict tumour recurrence stratification (HR, 1.933; 95% CI: 1.093?3.418;�P=0.021). Previous studies have also demonstrated the high predictive power of the XGBoost model37,38. Recently, interpretable machine learning has solved the ?black box? phenomenon. SHAP, a highly practical machine-learning interpretation tool, can visualize each feature?s overall or individual contribution and promote the clinical application of models, boosting clinicians? confidence in using predictive models11. The weights and effects of four independent prediction features in the combined model we have built are shown through SHAP. Case analysis demonstrates the contributions of these four features in the case and calculates the final Shapley value, thereby obtaining the final prediction probability and achieving personalized prediction.",Noninvasive prediction of perineural invasion in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma by clinicoradiological features and computed tomography radiomics based on interpretable machine learning: a multicenter cohort study
948,How do the peritumoral radiomics features in the study relate to the tumor microenvironment and potential implications for predicting PNI in liver cancer patients as mentioned in the text?,"Seven radiomics features, including six peritumoral features and one entire feature, successfully demonstrated the feasibility of CT radiomics features to predict PNI pathological information. Interestingly, seven radiomics features all involved the liver region surrounding the tumour. This might reflect an aggressive tendency to invade the tumour capsule and protrude into the peritumoral non-neoplastic parenchyma. The radiomics features of the peritumoral region can reflect the tumour microenvironment. Recent studies have demonstrated that neuromodulation is important in remodelling the immune microenvironment4,25,26. Meng�et al.27�also found that the PNI-positive status of ICC was associated with decreased NK cells and increased neutrophils. In addition, peritumoral radiomics features contain some important characteristics related to treatment and prognosis, confirmed in cervical28, breast29, and liver cancers19,30. Our study demonstrates the significant importance of radiomics, especially peritumoral radiomics, in predicting PNI. It may help elucidate whether PNI occurs more frequently in the tumour-periphery region and whether there is a specific association with the immune microenvironment and prognosis. These aspects warrants further investigation in our future studies.",Noninvasive prediction of perineural invasion in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma by clinicoradiological features and computed tomography radiomics based on interpretable machine learning: a multicenter cohort study
949,I am curious about how the SHAP visualization technique was used to understand the model prediction process in this study. Could you provide more details on how SHAP was implemented and what insights were gained from visualizing the model predictions?,"In this study, we established a PNI radiomics signature based on 136 arterial phase- and portal venous phase-enhanced CT images, combined clinical and radiological features to construct a comprehensive model, and compared four commonly used machine-learning models to determine the optimal performance model for predicting PNI in patients with ICC. Its performance was successfully verified in external (81 patients), and prospective cohorts (26 patients). Meanwhile, we compared RFS between PNI from institution III and attempted to evaluate the predictive value of the combined model for RFS. Finally, we used SHAP to visualize the entire model prediction process, from the overall to the individual levels. These results indicate that the combined model incorporating radiomics signature and clinicoradiological features is a feasible tool for evaluating PNI status and can be used for prognostic stratification, with XGBoost machine learning being more accurate and robust.",Noninvasive prediction of perineural invasion in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma by clinicoradiological features and computed tomography radiomics based on interpretable machine learning: a multicenter cohort study
950,What specific characteristics or features did the XGBoost combined model identify as most important when predicting the probability of positive PNI expression in patients?,"We calculated the overall and individual Shapley values for the XGBoost combined model interpretation and clinical application. In the overall visualization, the SHAP bar chart (Fig.�4A) shows the weights of the four most important characteristics (radsocre, PLR, arterial phase enhancement, and tumour location) of the model. The average Shapley values were 0.38, 0.28, 0.28, and 0.25, respectively, with the radscore having the highest weight. The SHAP bees-warm plot (Fig.�4B) shows each feature?s positive or negative effects on the prediction probability in red and blue. In predicting the probability of positive PNI expression, the radscore, tumour location, and PLR had a positive effect, while arterial phase enhancement had a negative effect. The SHAP heatmap plot (Fig.�4C) shows each feature?s direction and intensity of influence in all model cases, whereas the SHAP decision plot (Fig.�4D) shows the impact process of each significant feature on the final predicted probability. In the individual visualization, Fig.�5�shows four typical examples of correctly predicted PNI positivity and negativity.

The performance of the radiomics model (AUCs of 0.792, 0.748, and 0.729 in the training external validation, and prospective cohorts, respectively) was superior to that of the clinical model (AUCs of 0.660, 0.601, and 0.586, respectively; DeLong?s test, all�P<0.05) but comparable to that of the radiological model (AUCs of 0.796, 0.826, and 0.726, respectively; DeLong?s test,�P=0.196?0.981). The combined model included four commonly used machine-learning models (LR, XGBoost, RF, and SVM), with AUCs exceeding 0.796, 0.755 and 0.714 in training, external validation, and prospective cohorts, respectively. In the training cohort, the XGBoost model outperformed the RF and SVM models (DeLong?s test, all�P<0.05), but showed no significant difference compared to the LR model (DeLong?s test,�P=0.083). In the external validation cohort and prospective cohort, there were no significant differences observed between the XGBoost model and the other three machine-learning models (DeLong?s test,�P=0.059-0.740). However, XGBoost exhibited improved accuracy and robustness in all cohorts based on comprehensive predictive metrics.

All radiomics features were standardized using z-scores and ComBaTool, a free online application (https://forlhac.shinyapps.io/Shiny_ComBat/)20,21. Principal component analysis was used to visualize the correction of batch effects on these features by ComBats. We followed a four-step procedure to identify robust radiomics features in the training cohort. First, features with high stability (inter-class correlation coefficient >0.75) in the test-retest settings were retained for further analysis. Second, univariate statistical analysis was performed on the features, with a significance of�P<0.05. Third, we used Pearson?s or Spearman?s correlation analyses (|r|>0.80) to ensure low collinearity. Finally, to prevent overfitting of the model, ElasticNet was used to select the final radiomics risk factors of the PNI22. The penalty parameter tuning was conducted by 10-fold cross-validation, and the mixing parameters were set to (?=?1.80, �=0.5).

960,Can you explain how the interpretability method SHAP can be used to improve the clinical application of CT radiomics in predicting PNI in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC)?,"Computed tomography (CT) is a common noninvasive imaging method important for ICC diagnosis and preoperative evaluation. However, it is challenging for radiologists to assess the PNI status based on macroscopic CT images. Radiomics converts medical radiologic images into high-throughput quantitative features, thus providing information about tumour pathophysiology. It has shown great potential in characterizing tumour phenotypes and improving cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response9. Traditional machine learning often lacks interpretability, leading to the ?black box? problem, which is not conducive to clinical application. The Shapley additive explanation (SHAP), an emerging interpretability method, can explain the ?black box? problem from both global and local domains10,11.

Research has progressed from focusing solely on ?screen time? to exploring the social, emotional, and cognitive dimensions of SMU. When measuring sleep outcomes, researchers have investigated the sleep duration and quality and also consider factors such as chronotype and pre-sleep arousal, which will enable a better understanding of how social media impacts sleep in a broader context. Similar advancements have also been made in the field of SMU-related mental health research. Recognizing the interconnections among SMU, sleep, and mental health is crucial for public health and will contribute to improving sleep and mental health outcomes while promoting rational SMU.

967,"Can you provide more information on how cognitive factors, such as FOMO and self-esteem, mediate the relationship between smartphone use and mental health?","It has been suggested both behavioral and cognitive factors mediate the impact of SMU on mental health. Among the behavioral factors, sleep has been identified as one of the notable mediators of the association [31,�44,�45?,�46,�50,�59,�75]. Physiologically, prolonged SMU before bedtime delays sleep onset, reduces sleep duration, and mediates the association between eveningness and sleep as well as daytime sleepiness [44], which have been identified as risk factors for mental illness [76?78]. This complex interplay between sleep and mental health has also been documented in interventional studies. Our previous clinical trial demonstrated that a brief insomnia prevention program, adapted from cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia, significantly decreased the severity of depressive symptoms in adolescents at 12-month follow-up [79], suggesting the potential mediating role of sleep in mental health. While for the cognitive factors, FOMO has been recognized as a possible mediator. In particular, Elhai et al. reported that FOMO mediated relationship between anxiety and smartphone use frequency, as well as problematic SMU [80]. Besides FOMO, recent literatures have also identified several other cognitive factors that mediate the relationship between SMU and mental health, such as self-esteem [38?], body satisfaction [57], and emotional investment [59].",The Impact of Social Media Use on Sleep and Mental Health in Youth: a Scoping Review

Five of these studies reported significant associations among SMU, sleep, and mental health outcome [31,�45?,�46,�50,�59]. It was reported that SMU was significantly associated with poor sleep quality and increased mental health issues [31,�45?,�46,�50,�59], and sleep was found to mediate the negative impacts of SMU on mental health and emotional symptoms in adolescents [45?]. Poor sleep was also shown to be significantly associated with mental health outcomes [31,�50,�59]. Furthermore, adolescents with higher level of depressive symptoms were at higher risk of experiencing negative impacts of bedtime SMU on sleep outcomes [46]. Indeed, these findings preliminarily unveiled the complex interplay among SMU, sleep, and mental health.",The Impact of Social Media Use on Sleep and Mental Health in Youth: a Scoping Review
970,How do the findings from the cross-sectional studies suggest a potential bidirectional relationship between social media use and mental health in adolescents?,"A total of 9 cross-sectional studies examined the relationship between SMU and mental health [33?,�34,�38?,�39?,�56?,�57?60]. A greater amount of time spent on social media was associated with an increased risk of depression, self-harm, and lower self-esteem. On the other hand, adolescents who exhibited mental health issues tended to spend more time on social media platforms, suggesting a potential bidirectional relationship between SMU and mental health. However, it is important to point out that despite appealing hypotheses, actual effect size estimates of SMU on various mental health outcomes (e.g., self-esteem, life satisfaction, depression, and loneliness) were of small-to-medium magnitude as reported in previous meta-analytic studies, ranging from???0.11 to???0.32 [61?,�62].",The Impact of Social Media Use on Sleep and Mental Health in Youth: a Scoping Review
971,How do longitudinal studies differ from cross-sectional studies in terms of their findings regarding the association between screen media use and sleep disturbances in youth?,"Both longitudinal and cross-sectional studies tend to support the association between SMU and sleep disturbances (Table�1). A total of 17 cross-sectional studies observed an association between SMU and various sleep parameters in youth. Of these studies, a total of 16 reported a significant association between different dimensions of SMU (internet addition, duration of screen use, inappropriate time use (near bedtime), with one additionally measure parent control of technology) and poor sleep outcomes (both subjectively and objectively measured sleep parameters, such as bedtime, sleep-onset latency, sleep duration, and sleep quality) [31,�32?,�35,�36,�40,�42?44,�45?,�47?53]. Nevertheless, a study of 101 undergraduate students did not find that bedtime SMU was detrimental to sleep [46]. However, in the subgroup analysis, the authors found that youth with increased levels of depressive symptoms are at higher risk of experiencing negative impacts of bedtime SMU on sleep [46].",The Impact of Social Media Use on Sleep and Mental Health in Youth: a Scoping Review
972,Can you provide examples of the specific self-report questionnaires used in studies to measure social media usage in relation to mental health?,"In terms of the measurement of SMU, all studies used either self-developed questionnaires (e.g., ?in a typical school week, how often do you check social media?? and ?on a normal weekday, how many hours you spend on social medias, write blogs/read each people blogs, or chat online??) or validated self-report questionnaires (e.g., the 26-item Chinese Internet Addiction Scale-Revised and the Online Civic Engagement Behavior Construct). Different dimensions of SMU were measured such as overall and night-time SMU, problematic SMU, emotional investment in social media, racial discrimination, and racial justice civic engagement on social media. Only a limited number of studies incorporated more reliable measurements such as ecological momentary assessment [42] and total message count [43].",The Impact of Social Media Use on Sleep and Mental Health in Youth: a Scoping Review
973,"How do objective measures, such as time trackers and social media platform data, contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of social media use on mental health compared to self-reported measures?","In addition, the duration and timing of SMU also have significant implications for sleep and mental health, as excessive or inappropriate use of social media at certain timing, for example at bedtime, can potentially contribute to negative biopsychosocial effects. The Socio-Digital Participation Inventory includes four items to measure the frequency of SMU on a seven-point frequency scale (1?=?never, 2?=?a couple of times a year, 3?=?monthly, 4?=?weekly, 5?=?daily, 6?=?multiple times a day, 7?=?all the time) [25?]. The total time spent on SMU (in daytime and night-time) are usually captured by questionnaires and social media time use diary [38?]. In view of the limitation of self-reported measures, there has been a shift towards incorporating more objective measures in addition to subjective self-report scales. Increasing number of studies used time tracker via specific apps (installed on participants? devices used for online activity) to reduce recall bias [33?]. Other objective features, such as the number of followers, likes, comments, shares, bookmarks, and total interactions, which can be retrieved from various social media platforms [39?] were also used to reflect social medica engagement. In addition, the content (e.g., educational vs non-educational) posted, read, and shared on social media platforms plays a significant role in shaping user experiences, engagement levels, and the overall impact of SMU. It is worth to note that no included studies attempted to measure multi-device SMU as it can be challenging due to the wide range of devices that people use to access social media platforms. Traditional research methods often rely on self-reporting, surveys, or tracking software installed on specific devices, which may not capture the full extent of multi-device usage. Some individuals may switch between multiple devices throughout the day, making it challenging to track their overall social media engagement accurately.",The Impact of Social Media Use on Sleep and Mental Health in Youth: a Scoping Review
974,"How does the concept of social media use (SMU) differ from electronic media use, and why is SMU specifically chosen as the focus of this scoping review?","SMU refers to the act of engaging with online platforms specifically designed for social interaction, whereas electronic media use (or digital use, digital media, internet use, screen time) is a broader term that encompasses various forms of media delivered electronically, including but not limited to social media. In this scoping review, we focus on SMU.",The Impact of Social Media Use on Sleep and Mental Health in Youth: a Scoping Review
975,What specific strategies or interventions are suggested in the text for addressing the negative impacts of social media use on sleep and mental health among youth?,"Despite the emerging evidence supporting the link among SMU, sleep, and mental health, the relationship and directionality are complex and inconsistent. For example, two recent studies did not find significant associations among SMU, sleep, and mental health [24,�25?]. Nonetheless, a US study reported that greater SMU was significantly associated with sleep disturbances [26], and some also reported bidirectional relationship at which poor sleepers tend to use electronic devices as a sleep aid [27]. In general, it is believed that youth are at a higher risk of experiencing the negative impacts of SMU as they are more susceptible to peer pressure and fear of missing out (FOMO). FOMO refers to the perception of missing out on enjoyable experiences, followed up with a compulsive behavior to maintain these social connections with others to avoid being excluded from those experiences [28?30]. Hence, understanding the association and directionality among SMU, sleep, and mental health is crucial for developing public health strategies on how to cultivate healthy SMU habits and develop effective interventions targeting inappropriate and excessive SMU.",The Impact of Social Media Use on Sleep and Mental Health in Youth: a Scoping Review
976,How do sleep disturbances and mental health problems in youth impact their risk for psychiatric illnesses and risky behaviors?,"Youth population, which typically refers to individuals between the ages of 15 and 24, experience substantial changes in their neurobiology, physical development, behavior, and emotions, making it a vulnerable stage for the development of both sleep and mental health problems [1?3]. In Hong Kong, approximately 64.5% of adolescents sleep less than 8�h during weekdays [4] and 29.2% have reported insomnia symptoms [5]. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have demonstrated that sleep loss and disturbances in youth lead to significant personal distress, increase risk of psychiatric illnesses, and risky behaviors such as drug abuse and dangerous driving [5,�6]. In addition to sleep disturbances, mental health problems are highly prevalent among the youth population. Evidence suggested that nearly 75% of psychiatric illnesses have their age onset during adolescence [7,�8].",The Impact of Social Media Use on Sleep and Mental Health in Youth: a Scoping Review
977,"How do cross-sectional and longitudinal cohort studies differ in their approach to studying the impacts of social media usage on sleep and mental health, and what are some potential limitations of each type of study design in this context?","Both cross-sectional and longitudinal cohort studies demonstrated the negative impacts of SMU on sleep and mental health, with preliminary evidence indicating potential benefits especially during the COVID period at which social restriction was common. However, the limited longitudinal research has hindered the establishment of directionality and causality in the association among SMU, sleep, and mental health.",The Impact of Social Media Use on Sleep and Mental Health in Youth: a Scoping Review
978,"How do the effectiveness of digital mental health literacy (DMHL) interventions compare to face-to-face interventions, and what specific outcomes were improved by DMHL interventions in the meta-analysis?","Our review and meta-analysis found that DMHL interventions are as effective as face-to-face interventions. Basic DMHL interventions with self-help DMHL psychoeducation had similar effectiveness to that of interventions that incorporated DMHL as a secondary component with other active treatment components in bolstering mental health functioning. These findings are practically meaningful and underscore the feasibility and promise of digital modalities for improving mental health. DMHL interventions greatly increased literacy outcomes and moderately improved mental health functioning by reducing depression, anxiety, loneliness, and internalizing and externalizing symptoms and enhancing quality of life and resilience. Importantly, these effects, which did not differ by platform type or dosage, were sustained over time. Future research is needed to test our findings on the circumstances in which DMHL interventions are the most effective in enhancing mental health?specific DMHL components, dosage, extent of carryover effects, platform affordances, and individual and contextual factors?to aid policy makers, mental health professionals, and social services in establishing high-performance DMHL interventions that enhance mental health in the community.",The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
979,"Can you elaborate on how the features of DMHL interventions, such as dosage and platform affordances, can influence user engagement and the effectiveness of the intervention?","Third, the features of DMHL interventions, such as dosage and platform affordances, warrant greater attention given that research on digital mental health interventions has demonstrated how these features can influence user engagement and the effectiveness of the intervention [8,9]. This synthesis was limited to sex comparisons involving cissex individuals even though transsex and nonbinary individuals are at greater risk of mental health issues. Future work needs to expand the consideration of sex beyond binary operationalizations. We did not find evidence for the role of the commonly endorsed dosage of 10 weeks of digital mental health interventions that included DMHL components and of platform interactivity affordances in amplifying the mental health impact of DMHL interventions. Future work should examine varying dosages of DMHL interventions and different affordances and their additive and interactive effects through empirical examination using an RCT study design.",The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
980,Can you explain more about the different components of DMHL interventions and how they are categorized in terms of their focus and treatment approach?,"Our systematic review and meta-analysis highlights 4 major limitations in the broader literature on DMHL interventions. First, there is a lack of a clear conceptualization that distinguishes the DMHL components assessed in the interventions. Our review of existing literature and efforts to synthesize findings on the effectiveness of DMHL interventions suggest that, conceptually,�DMHL only�interventions refer to those that implement DMHL as a self-help psychoeducation component. In contrast,�DMHL plus�interventions incorporate DMHL as a secondary component with other active treatment components that are nonprofessional and informal in nature, for instance, skills training; peer support; group discussions and activities; exercises such as diary entries and reflection logs; and informal counselor interactions, and non-DMHL interventions refer to treatment as usual that involves client-professional visits, interactions, and therapies. Although receiving professional mental health treatment likely improves knowledge about mental health symptoms and management (eg, MHL), such interventions are not specifically focused on literacy. As such, they are categorized as non-DMHL interventions. These conceptual distinctions in DMHL interventional components have yet to be acknowledged in the current research despite the fact that all DMHL interventions included in our meta-analysis examined various conditions that could be classified as�DMHL only,�DMHL plus, and non-DMHL.",The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
981,How do the limitations in diversity and representation in DMHL interventions impact the overall effectiveness and generalizability of these interventions?,"Consistent with most mental health research [42-44], Western cultural contexts were overrepresented in the DMHL interventions, particularly countries in the Global North such as Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Comparatively, there are limited studies conducted in the Global South that involve Eastern cultural contexts in Asian countries and scant research on DMHL interventions from South American and African countries, limiting assessments of DMHL intervention effectiveness in the Global South. Furthermore, most studies on DMHL interventions included in this review did not provide information on the ethnic or racial composition of their samples, and those that provided this information had samples that were predominantly White with limited racial or ethnic diversity. Our findings reinforce existing research on digital mental health interventions broadly that indicated that these interventions were designed for and evaluated on implementation and clinical effectiveness with largely homogeneous samples that are disproportionately White, from the Global North, and likely cissex [42-44]. Findings from our review and meta-analysis on DMHL, coupled with those on digital mental health interventions [42-44], highlight the need for more consideration of diversity in research but broadly support the utility of DMHL interventions.",The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
982,"Can you provide more information on how the different facets of Digital Mental Health Literacy (DMHL) are positively associated with maturity, cognitive advancement, and educational attainment in adulthood, and how this relates to the effectiveness of interventions on different age groups?","DMHL intervention effects in this synthesis were comparable across sex and severity of mental health conditions. Other studies have found that female participants have higher levels of MHL [64,65], which can moderate the effects of DMHL interventions on mental health outcomes. When controlling for pre- and postintervention levels of MHL, we found that DMHL interventions had equivalent effects on increasing the mental health functioning of both male and female participants. Contrary to findings on the reduced effectiveness of digital mental health interventions in individuals with mental illness or with physical ill health [8], we found that the severity of mental health conditions did not attenuate the effectiveness of DMHL interventions on the mental health of healthy populations. We expected DMHL interventions to demonstrate greater effects on adolescents than on emerging and older adults given that adolescents are the primary users of digital platforms such as social media, mobile apps, and web-based mental health resources [30]. However, DMHL interventions appear to be most effective in emerging and older adults. The conceptual model of MHL describes the 5 facets of DMHL as positively associated with maturity, cognitive advancement, and educational attainment in adulthood [4]. As such, this helps explain why DMHL interventions had a greater impact on emerging and older adults? mental health. With increasing mental health concerns in adolescence [32,33], future research needs to illuminate whether and how some facets of DMHL are applicable to bolstering adolescent mental health and target these facets in the design and implementation of DMHL interventions for youth mental health.",The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
983,"How do specific platform affordances, such as interactivity, affect the effectiveness of digital mental health interventions, including DMHL interventions?","The effect of DMHL interventions on mental health holds across new interactive platforms and more conventional, less interactive platforms. Although there are numerous studies examining affordances of digital platforms, such as asynchronicity, anonymity, and social interactions [9], we have a limited understanding of how specific platform affordances interact with mental health?whether they bolster positive mental health or generate and exacerbate mental health problems. Specific to our study, we investigated the interactivity afforded by new and conventional digital platforms in moderating the impact of DMHL interventions on mental health as there are limited studies on DMHL interventions that tap into the full range of digital modalities [9]. Studies investigating social media platforms note different types of affordances that vary across platforms [96]. Importantly, the additive and interactive effects of different affordances in a specific platform could amplify users? emotional experiences and expressions, resulting in heightened emotional lability and susceptibility to mental health conditions [96]. However, empirical work on whether and how the affordances of social media and other digital platforms affect the effectiveness of digital mental health interventions, including DMHL interventions, is lacking. Future work on DMHL interventions should consider specific platform affordances and their interactions when modulating intervention effectiveness.",The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
984,"How do digital mental health interventions, particularly DMHL interventions, differ from traditional in-person interventions in terms of their long-lasting impact on mental health outcomes?","A key concern regarding digital mental health interventions is their long-lasting impact [36,40]. Particularly for DMHL interventions, the focus on knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes surrounding mental health may render their effectiveness short-lived [46,47]. In contrast, digital mental health interventions such as internet-based CBT are more well established in targeting behavior change and long-term mental health impacts [26]. Our meta-analytic results provide evidence of sustained positive effects of DMHL interventions on mental health. Specifically, studies on DMHL interventions that evaluated immediate postintervention effects and those that assessed carryover effects for as long 34 weeks demonstrated comparable mental health outcomes, particularly in mitigating mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, loneliness, and internalizing and externalizing symptoms [24,25] and bolstering mental well-being, for instance, resilience, life satisfaction, and quality of life [55,95]. More importantly, the sustained effects of DMHL interventions on improved mental health were not attenuated with longer follow-up assessments.",The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
985,Could you provide more information on the specific components of DMHL interventions that were found to be most effective in improving mental health functioning?,"Our review and meta-analytic results help reconcile the inconsistent findings on the effect of DMHL interventions on mental health documented in the existing literature that resulted from the comparisons of different DMHL components and study designs [15,16]. Although scholars argue that digital mental health interventions, especially DMHL interventions, have the potential to intervene in the mental health of individuals, the absence of consolidated evidence for DMHL interventions? (clinical) effectiveness presents a roadblock in promoting DMHL as a form of mental health prevention on a global scale [8,9]. Our meta-analytic efforts provide strong support for DMHL interventions achieving mental health effects. DMHL psychoeducation alone or coupled with active treatments is effective in bolstering mental health functioning compared with no intervention. However, for optimal mental health impact, self-help DMHL psychoeducation is not as effective as that provided with other active treatment components, such as skills training; peer support; group discussions and activities; exercises such as diary entries and reflection logs; and informal, nonprofessional counselor interactions. Of note, DMHL interventions that incorporated DMHL into other active treatment components had similar effectiveness to that of treatment as usual and professional therapies (non-DMHL interventions). These findings lend credence to DMHL as a scalable upstream prevention that translates to real-world mental health benefits in bolstering individuals? mental health functioning [8,9].",The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
986,Can you provide more information on the specific facets of Digital Mental Health Literacy (DMHL) that were found to have a strong effect on enhancing mental health outcomes in the study?,"Unlike the well-established research on traditional forms of mental health interventions [2], research on digital mental health interventions that leverage technological advancement is nascent [9,41]. Therefore, our findings make important contributions to the growing body of evidence that the implementation and clinical effectiveness of digital mental health interventions are comparable with, if not superior to, those of their traditional face-to-face counterparts [40]. Our study highlights the need for future research to elucidate the development and deployment practices of DMHL interventions for mental health that are scalable and cost-effective and maximize reach [92,93], which can overcome the shortcomings of traditional face-to-face MHL interventions [27,28]. In addition, our meta-analytic results indicate that DMHL interventions have a moderate effect on enhancing mental health outcomes and a strong effect on literacy outcomes. These findings suggest a mechanism of change involving MHL as a mediator or proximal outcome that in turn affects the distal outcomes of mental health conditions [94]. Given that few studies have examined the 5 facets of DMHL conjointly and separately with mental health functioning [16,55], research is needed to elucidate whether and how the 5 facets of DMHL relate to mental health?in particular whether certain facets are essential (or not) or whether combinations of facets yield stronger impacts.",The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
987,How do digital mental health literacy (DMHL) interventions compare in terms of efficacy when delivered through new digital platforms versus conventional platforms?,"Third, we elucidated whether stronger inferences can be drawn about the intervening effectiveness of DMHL interventions on mental health?whether they are fundamentally effective (pretest-posttest comparison) and more effective than (waitlist) control conditions or other (ie, non-DMHL) interventions. We found larger effect sizes for pretest-posttest DMHL intervention comparisons and waitlist control conditions versus DMHL interventions than for DMHL versus non-DMHL interventions. By comparing immediate and long-term effects, we found the benefits of DMHL interventions to be comparable at postintervention and follow-up assessments, with sustained effects on mental health regardless of longer follow-up assessments. This lack of fade-out of DMHL impacts is important and suggests that being more literate about mental health (recognition, prevention, and management) has long-term benefits for mental well-being. Finally, when considering how individual and contextual characteristics and dissemination methods might moderate the efficacy of DMHL interventions, we found no differences by sex, severity of preexisting mental health conditions, and cultural contexts and only slightly more efficacy in emerging and older adults than in adolescents. Our review and meta-analytic results indicate that digital platform interactivity and dosage of DMHL interventions do not enhance their efficacy. In particular, both new (involving mobile apps, web-based or internet platforms, and social media) and conventional (including films, videos, multimedia, and emails) platforms did not differ significantly in their impacts on mental health. The commonly administered dosage of 10 weeks for digital mental health interventions, including those with DMHL components, demonstrated a similar positive intervening effect on mental health to that of interventions with dosages below and above 10 weeks.",The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
988,How do DMHL interventions compare in terms of effectiveness to traditional face-to-face interventions in improving mental health literacy and functioning?,"First, we found that DMHL interventions are as effective as face-to-face interventions in improving MHL (SMD=0.64) and enhancing mental health functioning (SMD=0.42). DMHL interventions greatly improved pretest-posttest proximal DMHL outcomes, which involved various combinations of the 5 DMHL facets?knowledge about obtaining and maintaining good mental health; understanding mental illnesses and treatments; reducing stigma and enhancing help-seeking efficacy and attitudes; and more distal mental health conditions, such as anxiety, depression, loneliness, and distress; and bolstering well-being. Interestingly, we did not find greater uptake of and engagement with DMHL interventions (compared with control conditions), and uptake of DMHL interventions did not moderate the effects on both proximal MHL outcomes and distal mental health outcomes.",The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
989,"I would want to know why the study focused on comparing the effectiveness of digital mental health literacy interventions in Western and Eastern cultural contexts, and if this comparison provided any valuable insights into the potential implications of AI advancements on mental health in these regions.","The studies included in the meta-analyses involved 23 countries, but there were not enough studies from each country to allow for a comparison of effect sizes among individual countries. Instead, we followed the common approach of comparing Western and Eastern cultures [68,91]. Representatives of Western culture included Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States, whereas representatives of Eastern culture included China, Hong Kong, Pakistan, Singapore, and Taiwan. In contrast to hypothesis 5, we found that DMHL interventions conducted in Western and Eastern cultural contexts did not differ significantly in their effectiveness on mental health (Qbetween=1.13;�P=.64; Table S1 in�Multimedia Appendix 6).",The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
990,"Can you provide more details on the specific outcomes of the subgroup analyses that looked at the moderators of DMHL interventions, such as the differences in impacts on mental health between new interactive platforms and conventional platforms?","We investigated potential moderators of DMHL interventions on mental health functioning (Table S1 in�Multimedia Appendix 6�[90]) by performing subgroup analyses using meta-regressions to examine DMHL platform affordances (new interactive platforms, including mobile apps, web-based or internet platforms, and social media, vs conventional platforms, including films, videos, multimedia, and emails) and dosage of DMHL interventions as moderators. For dosage, we compared DMHL interventions of <10 weeks, 10 weeks, and >10 weeks. Contrary to hypothesis 2, DMHL interventions administered through new platforms that afford greater interactivity than more conventional platforms did not differ significantly in their impacts on mental health (Qbetween=2.51;�P=.31). In contrast to hypothesis 3, we found that the dosage of the DMHL interventions did not moderate their effectiveness on mental health outcomes (Qbetween=2.13;�P=.32), and similar positive intervening effects were found for all 3 dosage categories (Table S1 in�Multimedia Appendix 3).",The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
991,"Can you provide more information on the specific facets of digital mental health literacy (DMHL) that were assessed in the studies, and how they may have influenced the outcomes of the interventions on mental health?","As hypothesized, DMHL interventions had similar effectiveness to that of traditional face-to-face MHL interventions in bolstering mental health (Qbetween=4.12;�P=.18; hypothesis 1; Table S3 in�Multimedia Appendix 2). Addressing RQ 1a, DMHL interventions versus control conditions had comparable effects on uptake (odds ratio 0.998, 95% CI 0.91-1.03;�P<.001; Table S4 in�Multimedia Appendix 2). For RQ 1b, we found a high effect of DMHL interventions in increasing proximal literacy outcomes (ie, 5 facets of DMHL), with a pooled effect size of SMD=0.65 (95% CI 0.59-0.74;�P<.001), and a moderate effect in enhancing distal mental health outcomes, with a pooled effect size of SMD=0.42 (95% CI ?0.10 to 0.73;�P<.001). Unfortunately, few studies (2/144, 1.4%) differentiated the 5 facets of DMHL, and thus, we were unable to assess the effects of each DMHL facet on the outcomes. For RQ 1c,�we found that uptake of DMHL interventions did not moderate the effect of the interventions on proximal literacy outcomes (Qbetween=1.07;�P=.30).

Thus, there are insufficient studies (and number of effect sizes) to determine how the 5 facets of DMHL compare in their impacts on mental health. Although scholars have argued for the study of digital mental health interventions for specific mental health outcomes (eg, depression vs anxiety vs eating disorders [8,9]), the limited number of studies in the literature renders it impossible to study such specific effects, particularly for DMHL interventions. On the basis of the literature reviewed previously, we examined the following research questions (RQs) and hypotheses:",The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
1004,"How do cultural differences impact the effectiveness of digital mental health interventions, specifically in Western and Eastern cultural contexts?","Culture is a moderating contextual factor in the effectiveness of digital mental health interventions [66], but there is a dearth of research that investigates different cultures. Existing literature only allows for a comparison of the effects of DMHL interventions across Western and Eastern cultural contexts [67,68]. In more independence-oriented Western cultural contexts, values and norms are focused on developing a healthy sense of self, including positive mental health [67,68]. There is greater public awareness of mental health; less social stigma associated with help-seeking behaviors; and more concerted efforts to build mental health resiliency through the adoption and implementation of digital mental health interventions, including DMHL interventions [67,68]. Thus, in Western cultural contexts, greater MHL and a focus on mental health may amplify the effects of DMHL interventions. In contrast, most collectivistic, interdependence-oriented Asian societies are conservative in addressing mental health [67], and they promote MHL and positive mental health functioning in ways that differ from those of individualistic Western cultural contexts, for instance, cultivating interdependence relationships, relational harmony, and dialectical beliefs and emotions?a balanced state of opposites, including experiencing both positive and negative emotions, which are fused with and change into each other [68]. The increase in awareness of mental health issues is relatively recent, especially in contemporary Asian societies [69,70], which may be associated with weaker impacts of DMHL interventions on mental health [71]. The paucity of reviews and meta-analytic efforts that synthesize findings across international studies on digital mental health interventions makes findings about cultural context tentative and underscores the importance of this consideration in this study.",The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
1005,"Can you provide examples of how different digital platforms (such as mobile apps, web-based applications, social media, etc.) can impact the effectiveness of digital mental health interventions, especially those that include digital mental health literacy components?","To build a strong economic case for investing in digital mental health interventions that have clinical effectiveness (ie, reducing mental ill health and symptoms) broadly and on DMHL specifically, a key consideration is the dosage of the intervention [60]. Intervention durations that are too long or too short can affect its effectiveness [60], and typical digital mental health interventions that include DMHL components have a median dosage of 10 weeks [61,62]. However, it remains ambiguous whether this median of 10 weeks of intervention has a positive impact on mental health [60] and how it applies to the effectiveness of DMHL interventions. Hence, conclusive findings comparing different treatment dosages of DMHL interventions that demonstrate improvements or changes in mental health are necessary. Scholars have also argued that the features and affordances of digital platforms can factor into the effectiveness of digital mental health interventions by influencing users? initial uptake and sustained engagement [8,9]. Accumulating research indicates that technological affordances can vary across platforms, from linear, static websites to more interactive social media platforms and mobile apps [8,9]. Specifically, DMHL interventions are commonly delivered through new and more conventional platforms. New platforms involving mobile apps, web-based or internet applications, and social media afford greater interactivity [20,54], whereas more conventional platforms, including films, videos, multimedia, and emails, afford lower or limited interactivity [17,18]. Thus, this review considered how the duration of the intervention and platform of delivery affect outcomes.",The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
1006,"Can you provide more information on the specific mental health outcomes that traditional face-to-face MHL interventions have been found to improve, both in terms of proximal and distal outcomes?","Traditional face-to-face MHL interventions have found improvements in proximal mental health outcomes, particularly 1 or a combination of the 5 facets of MHL as well as distal mental health outcomes involving mental health conditions and functioning [56,57]. Extrapolating these findings to DMHL interventions, interventions targeting or incorporating different facets of MHL may have differential impacts on proximal and distal mental health outcomes [15,20]. However, there are insufficient DMHL studies that have investigated the 5 facets separately to distinguish their effects on mental health. Most studies have created composite variables of DMHL that comprise different combinations of the 5 facets [15,20]. Thus, with the available research on DMHL interventions, the synthesis of findings across studies is possible as a composite DMHL construct intervening in mental health to provide a conclusive understanding of the mental health impact of DMHL interventions.",The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
1007,Can you provide specific examples of the different components of DMHL interventions mentioned in the literature review?,"Our review of the DMHL intervention literature found that DMHL is typically the primary component?specifically, self-help DMHL psychoeducation that involves acquiring knowledge and information on mental health (hereafter referred to as�DMHL only�[16,20])?or a secondary component, incorporating DMHL psychoeducation with other active treatment components such as skills training; peer support; group discussions and activities; exercises such as diary entries and reflection logs; and informal, nonprofessional counselor interactions [15,21]. We refer to those interventions with DMHL as a secondary component as�DMHL plus. To establish the effectiveness of DMHL interventions, it is necessary to consider the DMHL component of each intervention. DMHL interventions have predominantly focused on comparing mental health outcomes through the following DMHL components: (1)�DMHL only�(vs waitlist control [20]), (2)�DMHL plus�(vs waitlist control [15,16,50]), (3)�DMHL only�versus�DMHL plus�[21,51], and (4)�DMHL only�or�plus�versus non-DMHL (treatment as usual with professional therapies such as CBT and dialectical therapy [28,52]). Although receiving professional mental health treatment likely improves knowledge about mental health symptoms and management (eg, MHL), such interventions are not specifically focused on literacy. As such, they are categorized as non-DMHL interventions. Studies often compare the effectiveness of different intervention components on mental health outcomes with inconsistent findings. To ascertain whether DMHL interventions are fundamentally effective (pretest-posttest comparison) and whether stronger inferences about the effect of DMHL interventions can be drawn?that is, how they compare with control and other intervention conditions?we synthesized findings across three study designs: (1) pre- and postintervention comparison [53,54], (2) intervention group versus (waitlist) control group [49,54], and (3) DMHL intervention versus non-DMHL intervention [28,49].",The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
1008,"How do digital mental health interventions, specifically DMHL, compare with traditional face-to-face delivery in terms of effectiveness and engagement?","With the burgeoning interest in digital mental health interventions, which combine scalability, translation to real-world benefits, and cost-efficiency with efficacy [8,9], substantive research has been devoted to understanding whether and how digital modes of delivering mental health services, including DMHL, are superior to or comparable with traditional face-to-face delivery [8,9]. Efforts to synthesize studies to compare the mental health impact of DMHL and traditional modes of MHL interventions are warranted to provide conclusive evidence on the effectiveness of DMHL interventions. In particular, research has focused on the implementation and clinical effectiveness of digital mental health interventions broadly (but not on DMHL specifically) by assessing uptake (ie, engagement and adherence) and mental health outcomes [26], respectively. Although there is evidence that digital mental health interventions increase uptake and engagement and that greater intervention uptake enhances mental health functioning [26], similar evidence specific to DMHL is lacking. DMHL studies are scattered in their efforts to understand the impact of DMHL interventions in terms of both uptake and intervening in mental health outcomes and whether intervention uptake affects mental health outcomes.",The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
1009,"How do DMHL interventions specifically target psychological readiness for enhancing mental health functioning, and how can this ultimately reduce the need for downstream interventions?","An accumulating body of work indicates that DMHL interventions can reduce the public health burden by decreasing burnout among working professionals and distress among students [36,37]. Poor MHL is a primary factor that hinders the uptake of, engagement in, and adherence to mental health treatment prevention and intervention [2]. DMHL interventions have the potential to not only provide greater access and reach and reduce stigma but also improve MHL among the public [34]. Indeed, research has shown that improved MHL can address self-identifying mental health difficulties and enhance help-seeking intentions and behaviors, which are key to initial engagement in and subsequent adherence to treatment [2]. Thus, DMHL intervention is an upstream form of mental health prevention that can reduce the need for downstream intervention [1]. For instance, incorporating DMHL into mental health initiatives as a regular form of psychoeducation can target psychological readiness for enhancing mental health functioning [38]. DMHL may also function as a mental health resilience factor that protects individuals from and mediates the negative effects of adversity and risk factors for the development of psychopathology [39].",The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
1010,How do digital mental health literacy (DMHL) interventions compare to traditional face-to-face mental health interventions in terms of effectiveness and efficiency?,"Scholars have argued that DMHL interventions combine ease of access and cost-efficiency with efficacy and are more effective on mental health [27,28]. DMHL interventions can overcome the shortcomings of traditional face-to-face MHL interventions, including low availability, a high threshold for participation, and substantial delivery costs [27,28]. DMHL interventions have several advantages [27,28]: (1) easy accessibility at any time and place; (2) assurance of anonymity to avoid stigmatization; (3) self-guidance for participants to work at their own pace and review materials as often as they want; (4) ability to reach individuals faster than traditional mental health services and prevent the onset of more severe mental health problems; and finally, (5) easy scalability, requiring only a small increase in resources to reach a greater proportion of the eligible population. Previous work has found that DMHL interventions combine ease of access and cost-efficiency with efficacy [27,28], whereas traditional face-to-face mental health treatment interventions that include DMHL components require close to 8 times more therapist time than digital ones [29].",The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
1011,What are some examples of non-DMHL interventions that are commonly used in digital mental health interventions and how do they differ from DMHL interventions?,"Existing work on DMHL interventions is scattered, and findings about the effects of DMHL interventions on mental health are mixed [14]. These inconsistent findings on DMHL interventions stem from how components of DMHL can vary across studies [15,16] and whether interventions assess the impact on proximal literacy outcomes only (facets of DMHL) [17,18], distal mental health outcomes only (mental health symptoms and conditions) [19], or both [15,16]. In particular, some interventions focus on DMHL as the primary intervening component, in which self-help psychoeducation is used to access information and learn about mental health [16,20]. Other interventions combine DMHL psychoeducation with types of treatment such as skills training; peer support; group discussions and activities; exercises such as diary entries and reflection logs; and informal, nonprofessional counselor interactions [15,21]. Digital mental health interventions that use DMHL as a primary or secondary component often include and are compared with other non-DMHL interventions. These non-DMHL interventions include treatment as usual with professional therapies (eg, cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT] and dialectical therapy) and skills training (eg, mindfulness [22,23]). Although receiving professional mental health treatment likely improves knowledge about mental health symptoms and management (eg, MHL), such interventions are not specifically focused on literacy. As such, they are categorized as non-DMHL interventions. Thus, it is unclear whether DMHL psychoeducation is sufficient or whether interventions need to incorporate DMHL with other active treatment components to improve individuals? mental health.",The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
1012,"How do researchers, policy makers, and mental health practitioners define and measure mental health literacy (MHL) in the context of addressing global mental health problems?","Worldwide, mental illness is projected to have an economic cost of approximately US $6 trillion owing to poor productivity and negative health functioning [1]. The World Health Organization and World Federation for Mental Health have advocated for increasing global awareness of mental health [1]. To increase global understanding of and address mental health problems, researchers, policy makers, and mental health practitioners have long recognized the significance of individual- and society-level mental health literacy (MHL) [2]. MHL refers to ?knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders which aid their recognition, management, or prevention? [3]. Low MHL in the general public is a key impediment to seeking mental health treatment [2]. A multifaceted construct, MHL comprises (1) understanding how to prevent mental illness, (2) understanding when a disorder is developing, (3) awareness of support and treatments for mental illness, (4) ability to effectively address mild mental health problems, and (5) mental health first aid skills to support others [4]. In more recent work, MHL has been expanded to include knowledge about (1) obtaining and maintaining good mental health, (2) understanding mental illnesses and treatments, (3) reducing mental illness?related stigma, (4) enhancing help-seeking efficacy or behaviors, and (5) enhancing help-seeking attitudes or intentions [5,6].",The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
1013,"Can you further explain how the effects of DMHL interventions on mental health outcomes differed between DMHL plus interventions, DMHL only interventions, and non-DMHL interventions (treatment as usual)?","Using 144 interventions with 206 effect sizes, we found a moderate effect of DMHL interventions in enhancing distal mental health outcomes (standardized mean difference=0.42, 95% CI ?0.10 to 0.73;�P<.001) and a large effect in increasing proximal mental health literacy outcomes (standardized mean difference=0.65, 95% CI 0.59-0.74;�P<.001). Uptake of DMHL interventions was comparable with that of control conditions, and uptake of DMHL interventions did not moderate the effects on both proximal mental health literacy outcomes and distal mental health outcomes. DMHL interventions were as effective as face-to-face interventions and did not differ by platform type or dosage.�DMHL plus�interventions (DMHL psychoeducation coupled with other active treatment) produced large effects in bolstering mental health, were more effective than�DMHL only�interventions (self-help DMHL psychoeducation), and were comparable with non-DMHL interventions (treatment as usual). DMHL interventions demonstrated positive effects on mental health that were sustained over follow-up assessments and were most effective in enhancing the mental health of emerging and older adults.",The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
